   - Difficulty: foundation
   - Skill focus: Define
   - Source reference: C1 questions, Q1
   - Answer:
     The smallest part of an element that can exist.
   - Explanation:
     An atom is the fundamental building block of matter, retaining the chemical properties of an element.

2. **What did scientists discover in the alpha scattering experiment?**

   - Topic: Atomic Models / Alpha Scattering Experiment
   - Difficulty: intermediate
   - Skill focus: Describe, Explain
   - Source reference: C1 questions, Q4
   - Answer:

   - Answer:
     Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels (shells).
   - Explanation:
     Bohr's model proposed that electrons exist in specific energy shells around the nucleus, and can move between these shells by absorbing or emitting energy.

     - D. D: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
   - Answer:
     B
   - Explanation:
     A mixture consists of two or more substances that are physically combined but not chemically bonded, meaning they retain their individual properties.

6. **State four physical processes that can be used to separate mixtures.**
   - Type: `short_answer`
   - Topic: Separating Mixtures
   - Difficulty: intermediate
   - Skill focus: Recall, List
   - Source reference: C1 questions, Q19
   - Answer:
     Filtration, crystallisation, distillation, fractional distillation, chromatography.
   - Explanation:
     These processes exploit differences in physical properties (like boiling point, solubility, particle size) to separate components of a mixture without chemical change.

   - Answer:
     Subtract the atomic number from the mass number (mass number - atomic number).
   - Explanation:
     The mass number (A) represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. By subtracting the number of protons (atomic number), you find the number of neutrons.

   - Type: `short_answer`
   - Topic: Electron Shells
   - Difficulty: intermediate

   - Source reference: C1 questions, Q14
   - Answer:
     Up to 2 in the first shell and up to 8 in the second and third shells.
   - Explanation:
     For the first 20 elements, electrons fill shells in a specific order: 2 in the first, then up to 8 in the second, and up to 8 in the third, influencing an atom's chemical properties.

10. **Which definition correctly describes isotopes?**
   - Type: `multiple_choice`
   - Topic: Isotopes
   - Difficulty: intermediate
   - Skill focus: Define, Identify
   - Source reference: C1 questions, Q18

   - Answer:
     C
   - Explanation:
     Isotopes are atoms of the same element, meaning they have the same number of protons, but they differ in the number of neutrons, leading to different mass numbers.
