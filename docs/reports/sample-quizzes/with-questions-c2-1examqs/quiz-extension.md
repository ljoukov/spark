- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Chemical reactions and equations
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Identification of reactants

- Answer: C) Lithium and Water
- Options:
  - A. A) Lithium and Hydrogen
  - B. B) Water and Lithium hydroxide
  - C. C) Lithium and Water
  - D. D) Lithium hydroxide and Hydrogen

> Reactants are the substances present at the start of a chemical reaction. In the given equation, lithium (Li) and water (H2O) are on the left side, indicating they are the reactants.

### 2. What is the chemical formula for lithium hydroxide, one of the products formed when lithium reacts with water?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Chemical reactions and equations
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall of chemical formulas from context
- Source reference: Page 1, Question 1(a)
- Answer: B) LiOH
- Options:
  - A. A) LiO
  - B. B) LiOH
  - C. C) LiH2O
  - D. D) Li2O

> The chemical equation explicitly states '2LiOH' as a product, which is the formula for lithium hydroxide.

### 3. Based on Figure 1, which substance is a solid at 0 °C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter and changes of state
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Data analysis, graph interpretation
- Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1
- Answer: B) B
- Options:
  - A. A) A
  - B. B) B
  - C. C) C
  - D. D) D

> Substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C. Since 0°C is below its melting point, substance B would be in a solid state at this temperature.

### 4. According to Figure 1, what is the approximate boiling point of substance B?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter and changes of state
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Data extraction from graph
- Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1
- Answer: C) 190 °C
- Options:
  - A. A) 70 °C
  - B. B) 100 °C
  - C. C) 190 °C
  - D. D) 200 °C

> By reading the graph for substance B, the boiling point (marked with a solid circle) is approximately 190°C.

### 5. Based on Figure 1, what is the approximate melting point of substance A?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter and changes of state
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Data extraction from graph
- Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1
- Answer: B) -20 °C
- Options:
  - A. A) -100 °C
  - B. B) -20 °C
  - C. C) 0 °C
  - D. D) 50 °C

> By reading the graph for substance A, the melting point (marked with an 'x') is approximately -20°C.

### 6. Suggest one reason why the student could not use the apparatus shown in Figure 2 to determine the exact melting point of substance B.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Experimental techniques, measurement accuracy
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Analysis of experimental design, identification of sources of error
- Source reference: Page 4, Question 1(f), Figure 2
- Answer: The thermometer is placed in the water bath, not directly in substance B, meaning it measures the water temperature rather than the substance's temperature directly. OR The water bath provides indirect heating, which may not ensure uniform or precise temperature measurement of substance B.

> For an exact melting point, the thermometer should be immersed directly into the substance being measured. In Figure 2, the thermometer is in the water, which acts as a heating medium, but does not directly measure the temperature of substance B itself, leading to potential inaccuracies.

### 7. What is the primary function of the water in the apparatus shown in Figure 2 when determining melting/boiling points?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Experimental techniques, heating methods
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understanding experimental setup
- Source reference: Page 4, Question 1(e), Figure 2
- Answer: C) To provide indirect and even heating
- Options:
  - A. A) To react with substance B
  - B. B) To cool substance B
  - C. C) To provide indirect and even heating
  - D. D) To dissolve substance B

> A water bath is commonly used to heat substances gently and evenly. The water ensures that the substance B is heated gradually and uniformly, preventing localized overheating.

### 8. For a given material, in which state of matter are the particles typically arranged in a regular, fixed pattern?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle model, states of matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall of particle arrangement in states of matter
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(b)
- Answer: C) Solid
- Options:
  - A. A) Gas
  - B. B) Liquid
  - C. C) Solid
  - D. D) Plasma

> In a solid, particles are closely packed in fixed positions and arranged in a regular, repeating lattice structure.

### 9. For a given material, in which state of matter do the particles possess the most kinetic energy?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle model, states of matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall of kinetic energy in states of matter
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(b)
- Answer: C) Gas
- Options:
  - A. A) Solid
  - B. B) Liquid
  - C. C) Gas
  - D. D) Plasma

> Gas particles have the highest kinetic energy because they are far apart and move rapidly and randomly, colliding frequently with each other and the container walls.

### 10. A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Besides being far apart, which other characteristic of gas particle movement does this model effectively demonstrate?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle model, states of matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Understanding models, recall of gas properties
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(a)
- Answer: C) The particles move randomly
- Options:
  - A. A) The particles move slowly
  - B. B) The particles are in fixed positions
  - C. C) The particles move randomly
  - D. D) The particles are different colours

> The shaking motion causes the balls to move in unpredictable directions and paths, accurately representing the random motion of gas particles. The study material explicitly lists 'The balls move randomly' as a good characteristic.
