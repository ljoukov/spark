## Questions

### 1. In the equation 2Li(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2LiOH(aq) + H₂(g), what does the state symbol (s) next to Li indicate? A) Lithium is a solution, B) Lithium is a solid, C) Lithium is soluble, D) Lithium is a solvent.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Chemical Equations
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall knowledge of state symbols
- Source reference: Page 1, Q1a
- Answer: Lithium is a solid
- Options:
  - A. Lithium is a solution
  - B. Lithium is a solid
  - C. Lithium is soluble
  - D. Lithium is a solvent

> The state symbol (s) stands for solid. The equation shows that solid lithium reacts with liquid water.

### 2. In the balanced chemical equation 2Li(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2LiOH(aq) + H₂(g), what is the stoichiometric ratio of lithium (Li) to hydrogen (H₂)? A) 1:1, B) 2:2, C) 2:1, D) 1:2.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Stoichiometry
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Interpret balanced chemical equations
- Source reference: Page 1, Q1a
- Answer: 2:1
- Options:
  - A. 1:1
  - B. 2:2
  - C. 2:1
  - D. 1:2

> The numbers in front of the chemical formulas (coefficients) show the ratio. There is a '2' in front of Li and an implied '1' in front of H₂, so the ratio is 2:1.

### 3. According to Figure 1, which substance has the highest boiling point? A) A, B) B, C) C, D) D.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Extract data from a graph
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A
  - B. B
  - C. C
  - D. D

> The boiling point is represented by the filled circle. Substance C's boiling point is at approximately 210°C, which is the highest value on the chart.

### 4. Using Figure 1, identify a temperature at which substance A is a gas, but substance B is a solid. A) -50 °C, B) 0 °C, C) 50 °C, D) 100 °C.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Compare and interpret graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: 50 °C
- Options:
  - A. -50 °C
  - B. 0 °C
  - C. 50 °C
  - D. 100 °C

> At 50°C, the temperature is above substance A's boiling point (approx. 0°C), making it a gas. At the same time, 50°C is below substance B's melting point (approx. 75°C), meaning it is still a solid.

### 5. Which of the substances A, B, C, or D from Figure 1 would be a liquid at standard room temperature (approximately 20°C)? A) A, B) B, C) C, D) D.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Apply graphical data to a real-world context
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A
  - B. B
  - C. C
  - D. D

> For a substance to be liquid, the temperature must be above its melting point and below its boiling point. At 20°C, only substance C (MP ≈ 10°C, BP ≈ 210°C) is in its liquid range.

### 6. The apparatus in Figure 2 uses a water bath. What piece of equipment could replace the water bath to allow for the measurement of substance B's boiling point (approx. 190°C)? A) An ice bath, B) A larger beaker of water, C) An oil bath, D) A cooling fan.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Suggest improvements to experimental procedures
- Source reference: Page 4, Q1e, Figure 2
- Answer: An oil bath
- Options:
  - A. An ice bath
  - B. A larger beaker of water
  - C. An oil bath
  - D. A cooling fan

> A water bath cannot exceed 100°C. To reach higher temperatures like 190°C safely, an oil bath or sand bath is used, as oil has a much higher boiling point than water.

### 7. Besides the substance being impure, what is another potential source of error when using the apparatus in Figure 2 that could lead to an inaccurate temperature reading? A) The Bunsen burner flame is yellow, B) Reading the thermometer from an angle, C) Using distilled water in the bath, D) The test tube is too clean.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Identify sources of experimental error
- Source reference: Page 4, Q1f, Figure 2
- Answer: Reading the thermometer from an angle
- Options:
  - A. The Bunsen burner flame is yellow
  - B. Reading the thermometer from an angle
  - C. Using distilled water in the bath
  - D. The test tube is too clean

> Reading a measurement scale from an angle instead of at eye level can cause parallax error, leading to an inaccurate reading. This is a common source of error in experiments involving thermometers, burettes, or rulers.

### 8. Which statement best describes the movement and energy of particles in substance B when it is in the solid state (e.g., at 25°C)? A) They move randomly and have high kinetic energy, B) They slide past each other and have medium kinetic energy, C) They are stationary and have no kinetic energy, D) They vibrate about fixed positions and have low kinetic energy.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Describe the properties of particles in a solid
- Source reference: Page 5, Q2b
- Answer: They vibrate about fixed positions and have low kinetic energy
- Options:
  - A. They move randomly and have high kinetic energy
  - B. They slide past each other and have medium kinetic energy
  - C. They are stationary and have no kinetic energy
  - D. They vibrate about fixed positions and have low kinetic energy

> In the solid state, particles are held in a fixed, regular arrangement (a lattice). They possess kinetic energy, but it is not enough to overcome the forces of attraction, so their movement is restricted to vibrations around their fixed positions.

### 9. The model of shaking balls in a tube (Question 2) is used to represent a gas. Which of the following is a key limitation of this model? A) The balls are too colourful, B) The model does not represent the forces of attraction between particles, C) The balls move too randomly, D) The balls are too far apart.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Evaluate the limitations of a scientific model
- Source reference: Page 4, Q2
- Answer: The model does not represent the forces of attraction between particles
- Options:
  - A. The balls are too colourful
  - B. The model does not represent the forces of attraction between particles
  - C. The balls move too randomly
  - D. The balls are too far apart

> Real gas particles have weak intermolecular forces of attraction between them. The solid balls in the model do not have any equivalent forces, which is a significant way in which the model is inaccurate.

### 10. For any given pure substance, what happens to the average kinetic energy of its particles while it is melting at a constant pressure? A) It increases, B) It decreases, C) It remains constant, D) It drops to zero.

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Apply knowledge of energy changes during phase transitions
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: It remains constant
- Options:
  - A. It increases
  - B. It decreases
  - C. It remains constant
  - D. It drops to zero

> During a phase change like melting, the energy being supplied (latent heat) is used to overcome the forces holding the particles in their fixed positions (increasing their potential energy), not to increase their speed. Therefore, the temperature, which is a measure of the average kinetic energy, remains constant until all the solid has melted.
