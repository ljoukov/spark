## Questions

### 1. According to the balanced equation 2Li(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2LiOH(aq) + H₂(g), what is the molar ratio of lithium (Li) to hydrogen (H₂)?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Stoichiometry
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpret balanced chemical equations
- Source reference: Page 1, Q1a
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A. 1:1
  - B. B. 1:2
  - C. C. 2:1
  - D. D. 2:2

> The numbers in front of the chemical formulas (coefficients) show the ratio. There is a '2' in front of Li and an unwritten '1' in front of H₂, so the ratio is 2:1.

### 2. Using Figure 1, calculate the temperature range in degrees Celsius over which substance B is a liquid.

- Type: numeric
- Topic: Changes of State
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Calculate from graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: 115

> Substance B melts at approximately 75°C and boils at approximately 190°C. The liquid range is the difference between these two temperatures: 190 - 75 = 115°C.

### 3. Using Figure 1, which substance has the smallest temperature range between its melting point and boiling point?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Changes of State
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpret and compare graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A. D
  - B. B. A
  - C. C. B
  - D. D. C

> By estimating the ranges: A is ~75°C, B is ~115°C, C is ~200°C, and D is ~20°C (-160 - (-180)). Substance D has the smallest liquid range.

### 4. Suggest one practical improvement to the apparatus in Figure 2 to ensure the heat from the Bunsen burner is distributed more evenly throughout the water.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Suggest improvements to experimental methods
- Source reference: Page 4, Figure 2
- Answer: Stir the water continuously.

> Stirring the water creates convection currents that distribute the thermal energy more evenly, preventing 'hot spots' and ensuring the thermometer gives a more accurate reading of the overall temperature.

### 5. Why would using an oil bath instead of a water bath be a more suitable choice for determining the boiling point of substance B using the apparatus in Figure 2?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Evaluate and select appropriate apparatus
- Source reference: Page 4, Q1e
- Answer: Oil has a much higher boiling point than water, so it can be heated to the 190°C required to boil substance B, whereas the water bath cannot go above 100°C.

> A water bath is limited by the boiling point of water (100°C). Since substance B boils at approximately 190°C, an oil bath, which can reach higher temperatures, is required to supply enough energy for it to boil.

### 6. The model of gas particles as small balls being shaken in a tube is useful, but has limitations. Which statement describes a key limitation of this model?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Identify limitations of a scientific model
- Source reference: Page 4, Q2
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A. The model does not represent the intermolecular forces between particles.
  - B. B. The balls are shown moving randomly, which is incorrect for a gas.
  - C. C. The balls are far apart, which is incorrect for a gas.
  - D. D. The model shows the particles as spheres, but real particles are cubes.

> Real gas particles have weak forces of attraction (intermolecular forces) between them. The model with hard balls that only interact by colliding does not account for these forces.

### 7. In which state of matter do particles have enough energy to overcome the forces holding them in fixed positions, but not enough to overcome the forces holding them close together?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Describe particle behaviour in different states
- Source reference: Page 5, Q2b
- Answer: Liquid

> In the liquid state, particles can move past one another (overcoming fixed positions) but are still held in close contact by intermolecular forces. In a gas, they have enough energy to overcome these forces almost completely.

### 8. In which state of matter do particles primarily vibrate about fixed positions?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall properties of states of matter
- Source reference: Page 5, Q2b
- Answer: Solid

> In the solid state, particles are held in a regular, fixed lattice and their kinetic energy is primarily in the form of vibrations around these fixed points.

### 9. The text states 'Lithium reacts with water to produce lithium hydroxide solution and hydrogen.' Which of these are the products of the reaction?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Chemical Reactions
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Identify products from a reaction description
- Source reference: Page 1, Q1a
- Answer: D
- Options:
  - A. A. Lithium and water
  - B. B. Lithium and hydrogen
  - C. C. Water and lithium hydroxide
  - D. D. Lithium hydroxide and hydrogen

> The products are the new substances formed in a chemical reaction. The text explicitly states that lithium hydroxide and hydrogen are produced.

### 10. What is the physical state of substance C at 100°C, according to Figure 1?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Determine state of matter from graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. Solid
  - B. B. Liquid
  - C. C. Gas
  - D. D. Aqueous

> Substance C has a melting point of approximately 10°C and a boiling point of approximately 210°C. Since 100°C is between these two temperatures, substance C will be a liquid.
