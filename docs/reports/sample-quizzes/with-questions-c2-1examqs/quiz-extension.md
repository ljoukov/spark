## Questions

### 1. Based on Figure 1, what is the state of substance B at 100°C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter, Phase changes, Data interpretation
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpreting graphical data, identifying states of matter at specific temperatures.
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: Liquid
- Options:
  - A. Solid
  - B. Liquid
  - C. Gas
  - D. Solid and Liquid coexisting

> From Figure 1, substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C and a boiling point of approximately 190°C. Since 100°C is above its melting point but below its boiling point, substance B will be in the liquid state.

### 2. For a given material, in which state of matter do the particles have the most kinetic energy?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Particle model, States of matter, Kinetic energy
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recalling characteristics of states of matter and particle energy.
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(b)
- Answer: Gas

> Particles in the gaseous state have the highest kinetic energy because they are moving rapidly and randomly, with large distances between them, allowing for greater freedom of movement compared to liquids or solids.

### 3. A different substance, E, has a melting point of -50 °C and a boiling point of +120 °C. What is the state of substance E at -75 °C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter, Phase changes, Data interpretation
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Applying knowledge of melting points to determine state at a given temperature.
- Source reference: Page 3, Question 1(d)
- Answer: Solid
- Options:
  - A. Solid
  - B. Liquid
  - C. Gas
  - D. Solid and Liquid coexisting

> Substance E has a melting point of -50°C. At -75°C, the temperature is below its melting point, meaning it will be in the solid state.

### 4. Suggest one reason why the student could not use the apparatus in Figure 2 to determine the exact melting point of substance B.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Experimental techniques, States of matter, Accuracy
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Evaluating experimental procedures, identifying sources of error.
- Source reference: Page 4, Question 1(f)
- Answer: The thermometer is in the water, not directly in substance B, so it measures the water temperature, not the substance's temperature. There might be a temperature difference between the water and substance B.

> For an exact measurement, the thermometer should be immersed directly into the substance whose melting point is being determined. In Figure 2, the thermometer is in the water bath, which may not be at the exact same temperature as substance B, leading to an inaccurate reading for substance B's melting point.

### 5. Which of the following best describes the arrangement of particles in a liquid?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle model, States of matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recalling characteristics of states of matter.
- Source reference: General knowledge from Page 1, Page 5
- Answer: Closely packed but able to slide past each other
- Options:
  - A. Closely packed in fixed positions
  - B. Widely spaced and moving randomly
  - C. Closely packed but able to slide past each other
  - D. Arranged in a regular lattice structure

> In a liquid, particles are still relatively close together but are not held in fixed positions like in a solid. They can move and slide past one another, which is why liquids can flow and take the shape of their container.

### 6. Describe how the movement of particles changes when a liquid turns into a gas.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Particle model, States of matter, Phase changes
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explaining changes in particle behavior during phase transitions.
- Source reference: General knowledge from Page 1, Page 5
- Answer: When a liquid turns into a gas, the particles gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them. They move much faster, become widely spaced, and move randomly and chaotically throughout the entire volume available.

> As a liquid is heated to its boiling point, particles absorb energy, increasing their kinetic energy. This allows them to break free from the intermolecular forces holding them in a relatively fixed volume, leading to a transition to the gaseous state where particles are far apart and move with high speed and randomness.

### 7. Referring to Figure 1, which substance has a melting point closest to 0°C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter, Data interpretation
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Reading and interpreting graphical data points.
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A
  - B. B
  - C. C
  - D. D

> From Figure 1: Substance A has a melting point of approximately -10°C. Substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C. Substance C has a melting point of approximately 10°C. Substance D has a melting point of approximately -180°C. Of these, -10°C (Substance A) is closest to 0°C.

### 8. What is the general term for the process where a solid turns directly into a gas without passing through a liquid phase?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: States of matter, Phase changes
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recalling scientific terminology for phase changes.
- Source reference: General knowledge from Page 1
- Answer: Sublimation

> Sublimation is the phase transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state, without passing through the liquid state. An example is dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) turning into gaseous carbon dioxide.

### 9. If the small balls in the model (Question 2) were to represent a liquid, which statement would be true about their movement and arrangement compared to a gas?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle model, States of matter, Analogy
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Applying the particle model to different states and comparing them.
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(a) and 2(b)
- Answer: The balls would be more closely packed and move more slowly than in a gas.
- Options:
  - A. The balls would be more widely spaced and move more randomly than in a gas.
  - B. The balls would be more closely packed and move more slowly than in a gas.
  - C. The balls would be in fixed positions and vibrate, unlike in a gas.
  - D. The balls would have less kinetic energy but still be widely spaced.

> In a liquid, particles are more closely packed than in a gas, and while they can move past each other, their movement is less energetic and random compared to gas particles. They would have less kinetic energy than gas particles, but not be in fixed positions like a solid.

### 10. In the reaction 2Li(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2LiOH(aq) + H2(g), what does the symbol '(s)' next to Lithium (Li) represent?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Chemical reactions, State symbols
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Interpreting state symbols in chemical equations.
- Source reference: Page 1, Question 1(a)
- Answer: Solid

> In chemical equations, state symbols indicate the physical state of the reactants and products. '(s)' stands for solid, '(l)' for liquid, '(g)' for gas, and '(aq)' for aqueous solution.
