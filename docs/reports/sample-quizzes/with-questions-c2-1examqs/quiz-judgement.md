# Sample 4: C2.1ExamQs.pdf (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The quiz demonstrates strong 'Answer precision', with all responses being factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material. 'Difficulty alignment' is also appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge. Furthermore, 'Safety & tone' are excellent, with no misinformation or off-spec content. However, the quiz requires revision due to issues with 'Question quality' in one instance and 'Coverage and balance' as several questions from the source material were omitted.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 0.70
  - Most prompts are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready. However, Question 2a's JSON structure for its 'type' and 'options' is inconsistent with the original prompt's instruction to 'Tick (✓) two boxes,' making it ambiguous how a user would interact with it in the quiz format.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers provided are factually correct and directly supported by the provided text, figures, and standard GCSE Chemistry knowledge.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.60
  - The questions cover key concepts related to states of matter and chemical reactions, with a suitable mix of multiple-choice and short-answer types. However, several questions from the original source material (Q1d, Q1f, and the second part of Q2b) have been omitted, leading to incomplete coverage of the provided content.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are well-aligned with GCSE Triple Science difficulty, ranging from foundation-level recall to intermediate data interpretation and higher-level application of experimental understanding.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz is free from misinformation, harmful content, or off-spec material. The tone is appropriate for a GCSE educational context, and UK English spelling is consistently used.

- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict to 'revise' is defensible, primarily due to the valid point raised under 'Coverage and balance'. The candidate quiz did omit several extractable questions from the source material (Q1f and the second part of Q2b). However, the judge's reasoning for downgrading 'Question quality' is flawed. The judge criticized the adaptation of question 2a from a 'tick two' format to a multiple-choice question, calling it 'inconsistent' and 'ambiguous'. This adaptation, where the correct option combines the two correct statements, is a standard and clear way to convert a multi-select question into a single-choice format. It is not ambiguous. Because the judge's reasoning is partially incorrect, the overall judgement needs review.

Rubric:
- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?
- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?
- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?
- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?
- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.
Use the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.
