# Sample 4: C2.1ExamQs.pdf (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The quiz demonstrates strong adherence to most rubric dimensions, particularly in Answer precision, Coverage and balance, Difficulty alignment, and Safety & tone. The questions are factually correct, well-aligned with GCSE Triple Science, and cover the key concepts from the provided source material comprehensively, including a good mix of question types. However, a minor revision is needed regarding Question quality. Specifically, the options for question 7 could be refined to ensure all distractors are plausible and directly relevant to the particle model of gases, avoiding options that are clearly contradictory or irrelevant, as one option currently is.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 0.90
  - Prompts are generally precise and exam-ready. However, the options for question 7 include 'The balls are in a regular pattern', which is a weak distractor for a gas model as it describes a solid, not a gas, and deviates from the original source's options for that specific part of the question.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers provided are factually correct and directly grounded in the source material or logical extensions of it. Explanations are clear and accurate.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 1.00
  - The quiz effectively covers all key concepts from the source material, expanding the original questions into a suitable number (20) with a good mix of multiple-choice, short-answer, and numeric question types. It addresses state symbols, graphical interpretation of melting/boiling points, practical considerations, and the particle model.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The items are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge level from foundation (e.g., recalling definitions, reading simple graph data) to intermediate (e.g., interpreting states at specific temperatures, evaluating experimental methods) and higher-level thinking (e.g., identifying limitations of apparatus).
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz is free from misinformation, harmful content, or off-spec material. The tone is appropriate for an educational context, and UK English spelling is consistently used.

## Audit

- Model: gemini-2.5-pro (temperature 0.15)
- Verdict agreement: disagree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict to 'revise' is based on a flawed assessment of question Q7's quality. The judge correctly notes that the candidate model replaced an option from the source material with a new one ('The balls are in a regular pattern'). However, the judge incorrectly labels this a 'weak distractor'. In the context of states of matter, using a property of a solid ('regular pattern') as a distractor for a question about a gas is a standard and effective method for assessing a student's understanding. It directly tests their ability to differentiate between the particle models for different states. The candidate model intelligently adapted a 'tick two' question from the source into two separate multiple-choice questions (Q7 and Q8), creating new and relevant distractors for both. This demonstrates strong quiz generation, not a weakness. The quiz is excellent and does not require revision.

## Prompt

```
You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.
Rubric:
- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?
- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?
- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?
- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?
- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.
Use the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.
Return JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.
verdict must be "approve" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise "revise" with actionable reasoning.
Provide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.
