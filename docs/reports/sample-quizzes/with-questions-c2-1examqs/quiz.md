  - C. C and D
  - D. A and D

> At 50°C, both substance A (boiling point 0°C) and substance D (boiling point -160°C) are above their boiling points, so they are gases.

### 4. A different substance, E, has a melting point of -50 °C and a boiling point of +120 °C. What would be the state of substance E at room temperature (25 °C)?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Apply knowledge of state changes
- Source reference: Page 3, Q1d
- Answer: Liquid

> Room temperature (25°C) is above the melting point of substance E (-50°C) but below its boiling point (+120°C), so it will be in the liquid state.

### 5. Figure 2 shows apparatus for determining melting and boiling points. Explain why the student could not use this apparatus to determine the boiling point of substance B.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Evaluate experimental methods
- Source reference: Page 4, Q1e
- Answer: The boiling point of substance B is approximately 190°C (from Figure 1), but the water bath can only reach a maximum temperature of 100°C.

> A water bath cannot be heated above the boiling point of water (100°C), which is significantly lower than the boiling point of substance B.

### 6. Suggest one reason why the student could not use the apparatus in Figure 2 to determine the exact melting point of substance B.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Identify limitations of experimental methods
- Source reference: Page 4, Q1f
- Answer: The water is not stirred, leading to uneven heat distribution and an inaccurate temperature reading.

> Without stirring, parts of the water bath and the substance may be at different temperatures, so the thermometer reading may not reflect the true melting point.

### 7. A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Which of these statements describes a way in which this is a good model?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: foundation

## Prompt

```
You are Spark's GCSE Triple Science quiz builder. Work strictly from the supplied study material.
The material already includes questions and answers. Extract high-quality exam-ready items.
Preserve original wording as much as possible while fixing small typos.
When the source already asks questions, transcribe every numbered task and sub-part. If an answer is missing, infer a correct one directly from the source material.
If the source is mostly notes with few (three or fewer) questions, keep any explicit questions first and then create additional items that still mirror the lesson content.
Never drop a question or answer that appears in the source. Expand multi-part tasks only when necessary to keep prompt, answer, and marking points aligned.
Represent the full breadth of the source. Include every major concept, definition, worked example, or sub-question that appears.
If you must merge short sub-parts to fit the questionCount, retain their core ideas and cite all relevant source references.
When the source lists numbered exam questions, cover every numbered item and its sub-parts—combine them into one prompt only when the combined question still requires every original answer.
Always write in UK English and reference the specification where relevant.
You must return exactly 20 questions.
Prioritise coverage breadth over repetition. If the source has more material than fits, select items so every key theme is still assessed.
Summaries and field values must never claim coverage that the questions do not provide; explicitly note any unavoidable omissions.
Return JSON that matches the provided schema. Field guidance:
- quizTitle: Concise, exam-style title for the quiz.
- summary: Two sentences. Sentence one states the scope, question types, and syllabus link. Sentence two must begin with "Coverage gaps:" and either say "none – full coverage achieved." or list the specific missing topics/processes.

- sourceReference: Precise citation (page, question number, or caption) so humans can trace the origin. Do not fabricate references.
- Always correct typographical or scientific errors from the source (e.g., prefer the standard UK spelling "phosphorus" even if the source writes "phosphorous").
- Keep prompts, requested counts, and answers aligned. If a question asks for a specific number of items, return exactly that many in the answer after choosing the most representative examples, or adjust the prompt text so the count and answer match.
- Tighten ambiguous wording when needed so the scientific term is explicit (e.g., say "relative atomic mass" rather than the vague "relative mass").
Subject focus: chemistry.
Exam board context: AQA.
Include concise sourceReference entries when you can identify page numbers, prompts or captions.
If the material lacks enough detail for a requirement, explain the limitation in the summary.
Verify that ids and sourceReference values align with the original numbering before returning the JSON.
