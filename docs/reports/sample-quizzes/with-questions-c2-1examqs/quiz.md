## Questions

### 1. Lithium reacts with water to produce lithium hydroxide solution and hydrogen. Use the correct state symbols to complete the chemical equation: 2Li(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2LiOH(__) + H2(__)

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Chemical reactions and equations
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Application of knowledge, recall of state symbols
- Source reference: Page 1, Question 1(a)
- Answer: aq, g

> Lithium hydroxide solution is an aqueous solution, denoted by 'aq'. Hydrogen is a gas, denoted by 'g'.

### 2. Figure 1 shows the melting points and boiling points of four substances, A, B, C and D. Which substance is liquid over the greatest temperature range?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter and changes of state
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Data analysis, graph interpretation
- Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A
  - B. B
  - C. C
  - D. D

> Substance C has a melting point of approximately 10°C and a boiling point of approximately 200°C, giving it a liquid range of 190°C (200 - 10), which is the largest among the given substances.

### 3. Referring to Figure 1, which two substances are gases at 50 °C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter and changes of state
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Data analysis, graph interpretation
- Source reference: Page 3, Question 1(c), Figure 1
- Answer: A and D
- Options:
  - A. A and B
  - B. B and C
  - C. C and D
  - D. A and D

> At 50°C, substance A (boiling point ~0°C) and substance D (boiling point ~-160°C) would both have boiled and therefore be in a gaseous state.

### 4. Substance E has a melting point of -50 °C and a boiling point of +120 °C. What is the state of substance E at 0 °C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter and changes of state
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Application of knowledge
- Source reference: Page 3, Question 1(d)
- Answer: Liquid
- Options:
  - A. Solid
  - B. Liquid
  - C. Gas
  - D. Plasma

> At 0°C, substance E is above its melting point (-50°C) and below its boiling point (120°C), meaning it is in a liquid state.

### 5. Figure 2 shows apparatus used to determine the melting and boiling points of substance B. Explain why this apparatus could not be used to determine the boiling point of substance B.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Experimental techniques, heating methods
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Analysis, explanation, evaluation of experimental design
- Source reference: Page 4, Question 1(e), Figure 1 and Figure 2
- Answer: The apparatus uses a water bath, which can only heat substances up to 100°C. Substance B has a boiling point of approximately 190°C, which is higher than the maximum temperature achievable with a water bath.

> A water bath is limited to heating substances up to 100°C, its own boiling point. Since substance B's boiling point is 190°C (from Figure 1), a water bath cannot provide sufficient heat to reach this temperature.

### 6. A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Which of the following is a characteristic of this model that accurately represents gas particles?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle model, states of matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall, understanding models
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(a)
- Answer: The balls are far apart from each other.
- Options:
  - A. The balls move slowly.
  - B. The balls are far apart from each other.
  - C. The balls are different colours.
  - D. The balls move in fixed positions.

> In a gas, particles are far apart from each other and move randomly. The model effectively demonstrates the large separation between particles.
