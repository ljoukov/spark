## Questions

### 1. Lithium reacts with water to produce lithium hydroxide solution and hydrogen. Use the correct state symbols from the box to complete the chemical equation: 2Li(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2LiOH(__) + H2(__)

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Chemical reactions, State symbols
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Applying knowledge of chemical reactions and state symbols.
- Source reference: Page 1, Question 1(a)
- Answer: aq, g

> Lithium hydroxide is formed as a solution in water, so its state symbol is 'aq' (aqueous). Hydrogen is a gas produced in the reaction, so its state symbol is 'g'.

### 2. Figure 1 shows the melting points and boiling points of four substances, A, B, C and D. Which substance is liquid over the greatest temperature range?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter, Phase changes, Data interpretation
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpreting graphical data, calculating temperature ranges.
- Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A
  - B. B
  - C. C
  - D. D

> To find the substance liquid over the greatest temperature range, calculate the difference between its boiling point and melting point. A: 20°C (10 - (-10)). B: 120°C (190 - 70). C: 200°C (210 - 10). D: 20°C (-160 - (-180)). Substance C has the largest range of 200°C.

### 3. Referring to Figure 1, which two substances are gases at 50 °C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of matter, Phase changes, Data interpretation
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpreting graphical data, identifying states of matter at specific temperatures.
- Source reference: Page 3, Question 1(c), Figure 1
- Answer: A and D
- Options:
  - A. A and B
  - B. B and C
  - C. C and D
  - D. A and D

> A substance is a gas when its temperature is above its boiling point. At 50°C, Substance A (Boiling Point ~10°C) is a gas. Substance B (Boiling Point ~190°C) is a solid. Substance C (Boiling Point ~210°C) is a liquid. Substance D (Boiling Point ~-160°C) is a gas. Therefore, A and D are gases at 50°C.

### 4. Figure 2 shows apparatus used to determine the melting and boiling points of substance B. Explain why this apparatus could not be used to determine the boiling point of substance B.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Experimental techniques, States of matter, Heating curves
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Evaluating experimental procedures, understanding limitations of apparatus.
- Source reference: Page 4, Question 1(e), Figure 2
- Answer: The apparatus uses water as the heating medium. Water boils at 100°C, but substance B has a boiling point of 190°C. Therefore, water cannot reach a high enough temperature to boil substance B.

> Substance B has a boiling point of 190°C (from Figure 1). The apparatus uses a water bath for heating. Water boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, meaning it cannot be heated above this temperature. Consequently, the water bath cannot provide enough heat to raise substance B to its boiling point of 190°C.

### 5. A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Which two characteristics make this a good model for gas particles?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle model, States of matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Understanding the particle model of gases.
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(a)
- Answer: The balls are far apart from each other and move randomly.
- Options:
  - A. The balls move slowly and are different colours.
  - B. The balls are far apart from each other and move randomly.
  - C. The balls are close together and move slowly.
  - D. The balls are different colours and move randomly.

> In the particle model of gases, particles are widely spaced and move randomly and rapidly. The model effectively demonstrates these two key characteristics. The speed of movement is not accurately represented by 'slowly', and colour is irrelevant.

### 6. For a given material, in which state of matter are the particles in a regular arrangement?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Particle model, States of matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recalling characteristics of states of matter.
- Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(b)
- Answer: Solid

> In a solid, particles are closely packed in fixed positions and arranged in a regular, repeating pattern (a lattice structure).
