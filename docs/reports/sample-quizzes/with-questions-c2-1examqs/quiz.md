### 4. Figure 1 shows the melting and boiling points of four substances. Which substance is liquid over the greatest temperature range?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpret graphical data and perform calculations
- Source reference: Page 2, Q1b, Figure 1
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A
  - B. B
  - C. C
  - D. D

> Substance C is liquid between approximately 10°C and 210°C, a range of 200°C. This is greater than the ranges for A (approx. 75°C), B (approx. 115°C), and D (approx. 20°C).

### 5. Using the data from Figure 1, calculate the temperature range in degrees Celsius over which substance C is a liquid.

- Type: numeric
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Extract and process graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Q1b, Figure 1
- Answer: 200

> Substance C has a melting point of approximately 10°C and a boiling point of approximately 210°C. The liquid range is the difference: 210 - 10 = 200°C.

### 6. Using the data from Figure 1, calculate the temperature range in degrees Celsius over which substance B is a liquid.

- Type: numeric
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Extract and process graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Q1b, Figure 1
- Answer: 115

> Substance B has a melting point of approximately 75°C and a boiling point of approximately 190°C. The liquid range is the difference: 190 - 75 = 115°C.

### 7. Which two substances shown in Figure 1 are gases at 50 °C?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpret graphical data
- Source reference: Page 3, Q1c, Figure 1
- Answer: A and D
- Options:
  - A. A and B
  - B. B and C
  - C. C and D
  - D. A and D

> A substance is a gas at a temperature above its boiling point. At 50°C, substance A (BP ≈ 0°C) and substance D (BP ≈ -160°C) are both above their boiling points.

### 8. A different substance, E, has a melting point of -50 °C and a boiling point of +120 °C. What would be the state of substance E at 0 °C?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Apply knowledge of state changes
- Source reference: Page 3, Q1d
- Answer: Liquid

> 0°C is above the melting point of -50°C and below the boiling point of +120°C, so substance E would be in the liquid state.

### 9. Substance E has a melting point of -50 °C and a boiling point of +120 °C. Is its liquid temperature range larger or smaller than that of substance B from Figure 1?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Calculate and compare data
- Source reference: Page 3, Q1d; Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: Larger

> The liquid range for E is 120 - (-50) = 170°C. From Figure 1, the range for B is approximately 190 - 75 = 115°C. Therefore, E's range is larger.

### 10. Figure 2 shows apparatus for determining melting and boiling points using a water bath. Explain why this apparatus could not be used to determine the boiling point of substance B (shown in Figure 1).

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain limitations of experimental apparatus
- Source reference: Page 4, Q1e, Figure 2
- Answer: The boiling point of substance B is approximately 190°C, which is above the boiling point of water (100°C). A water bath cannot reach a temperature higher than 100°C.

> A water bath's temperature is limited by the boiling point of water. To measure a boiling point of 190°C, a heating medium with a higher boiling point, such as an oil bath, would be required.

### 11. Suggest one reason why the apparatus shown in Figure 2 might not be suitable for determining the exact melting point of a substance.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Practical Chemistry
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Analyse experimental methods
- Source reference: Page 4, Q1f
- Answer: If the substance is impure, it will melt over a range of temperatures rather than at a sharp, exact point.

> Impurities disrupt the regular crystal lattice of a solid, lowering the melting point and causing it to melt over a range. This makes determining an 'exact' melting point difficult.

### 12. A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Which of the following is a correct reason why this is a good model?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Evaluate a scientific model
- Source reference: Page 5, Q2a
- Answer: The balls move randomly.
- Options:
  - A. The balls move randomly.
  - B. The balls are different colours.
  - C. The balls move slowly.
  - D. The balls are in a regular arrangement.

> A key property of particles in a gas is that they move rapidly and randomly, which is simulated by shaking the balls in the tube.

### 13. A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Besides their random movement, what is another feature of gas particles that this model correctly represents?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Evaluate a scientific model
- Source reference: Page 5, Q2a
- Answer: The balls are far apart from each other.
- Options:
  - A. The balls are far apart from each other.
  - B. The balls have strong forces between them.
  - C. The balls are different colours.
  - D. The balls vibrate in fixed positions.

> The model shows the balls with large spaces between them, which accurately represents the large intermolecular distances between particles in a gas.

### 14. For a given material, in which state of matter are the particles held in a regular arrangement?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall properties of states of matter
- Source reference: Page 5, Q2b
- Answer: Solid

> In the solid state, particles are held in fixed positions within a regular lattice structure, allowing them only to vibrate.

### 15. For a given material, in which state of matter do the particles have the most kinetic energy?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Particle Model
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall properties of states of matter
- Source reference: Page 5, Q2b
- Answer: Gas

> Particles in the gaseous state move most freely and at the highest speeds, meaning they have the greatest amount of kinetic energy.

### 16. Read the approximate melting point of substance A from the graph in Figure 1.

- Type: numeric
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Extract data from a graph
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1

### 17. Read the approximate boiling point of substance D from the graph in Figure 1.

- Type: numeric
- Topic: States of Matter

> The filled circle for substance D, which represents the boiling point, is located at approximately -160°C on the y-axis.

### 18. Using Figure 1, determine the physical state of substance C at exactly 10 °C.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpret graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: Melting / Solid and liquid

> 10°C is the melting point of substance C. At its melting point, a substance exists as a mixture of solid and liquid as it undergoes the phase change.

### 19. Using Figure 1, determine the physical state of substance A at 50 °C.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Interpret graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: Gas

> The boiling point of substance A is approximately 0°C. Since 50°C is above its boiling point, substance A will be a gas.

### 20. Using Figure 1, determine the physical state of substance B at 50 °C.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: States of Matter
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Interpret graphical data
- Source reference: Page 2, Figure 1
- Answer: Solid

> The melting point of substance B is approximately 75°C. Since 50°C is below its melting point, substance B will be a solid.

- Always correct typographical or scientific errors from the source (e.g., prefer the standard UK spelling "phosphorus" even if the source writes "phosphorous").
- Keep prompts, requested counts, and answers aligned. If a question asks for a specific number of items, return exactly that many in the answer after choosing the most representative examples, or adjust the prompt text so the count and answer match.
- Tighten ambiguous wording when needed so the scientific term is explicit (e.g., say "relative atomic mass" rather than the vague "relative mass").
