# Sample 4: C2.1ExamQs.pdf (extraction) — Extension Judge

**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent adherence to the rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is consistently high, with precise and unambiguous prompts that are exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is flawless, as all answers are factually correct and directly supported by the provided material or standard GCSE knowledge. The 'Coverage and balance' are strong, effectively extending the initial quiz by introducing stoichiometry, practical considerations, and deeper conceptual understanding of the particle model and phase changes, with a suitable mix of difficulty levels. 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with questions ranging from foundation to higher-tier concepts. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are maintained throughout, with no misinformation or off-spec content and correct UK English spelling.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready. The multiple-choice options are well-formed and provide plausible distractors.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material (figures, equations) or standard GCSE chemistry knowledge related to the topics. Explanations are clear and accurate.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.90
  - The quiz covers key concepts from the provided material and extends them appropriately (e.g., stoichiometry, practical limitations, energy changes during phase transitions). The difficulty is well-balanced across foundation, intermediate, and higher levels. While all questions are multiple-choice, this is acceptable for an extension quiz.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The items are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. The assigned difficulty levels (foundation, intermediate, higher) are accurate and well-distributed, ensuring varied challenge.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - There is no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The tone is academic and appropriate for GCSE, and UK English spelling is consistently used.

- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is entirely reasonable and well-supported. The candidate's quiz is of excellent quality, providing a set of questions that are factually accurate, well-aligned with the GCSE curriculum, and genuinely extend the concepts presented in the source material. The judge correctly identifies the strengths of the quiz across all rubric dimensions. The scoring is accurate; the 0.9 for 'Coverage and balance' is a fair and nuanced assessment, acknowledging that while the quiz is strong, its reliance solely on multiple-choice questions could be seen as a minor limitation, though acceptable for this task. The overall 'approve' verdict is fully justified.

## Prompt

```
You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.
Rubric:
- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?
- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?
- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?
- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?
- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.
Use the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.
Return JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.
verdict must be "approve" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise "revise" with actionable reasoning.
Provide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.
