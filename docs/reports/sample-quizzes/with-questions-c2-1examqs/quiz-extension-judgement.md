# Sample 4: C2.1ExamQs.pdf (extraction) — Extension Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong 'Question quality' with precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready prompts. 'Answer precision' is excellent, with all answers being factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material. The 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a good mix of foundation, intermediate, and higher-level questions. Furthermore, the quiz adheres to 'Safety & tone' guidelines, avoiding misinformation and using appropriate UK English spelling. However, the 'Coverage and balance' dimension requires revision. While the quiz thoroughly covers states of matter and particle theory, it lacks sufficient questions on chemical reactions, which is a significant part of its stated title and summary.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and well-phrased, making them suitable for an exam context.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All provided answers are factually correct and the explanations are clear, accurate, and directly supported by the source material or general scientific principles.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.50
  - The quiz is heavily skewed towards states of matter and particle theory, with 9 out of 10 questions focusing on these topics. Only one question addresses chemical reactions (state symbols). This imbalance does not align with the quiz title 'GCSE Chemistry: States of Matter and Reactions', which implies broader coverage of reaction-related concepts.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions offer a suitable range of difficulty, from foundation recall to intermediate data interpretation and higher-level experimental evaluation, appropriate for GCSE Triple Science.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz contains no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The tone is appropriate for an educational assessment, and UK English spelling is consistently used.

- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The core justification for the 'revise' verdict rests on the 'Coverage and balance' criterion, where the judge correctly identifies a significant imbalance. The quiz title is 'GCSE Chemistry: States of Matter and Reactions', yet 9 out of the 10 questions focus on states of matter and particle theory, with only a single question on chemical reactions (interpreting a state symbol). This skew makes the quiz's title and summary misleading. The judge's positive assessments of 'Question quality', 'Answer precision', and 'Difficulty alignment' are also appropriate, as the questions are generally well-constructed and cover a suitable range of cognitive skills for the target level.

## Prompt

You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.
Rubric:
- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?
- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?
- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?
- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?
- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.
Use the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.
Return JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.
verdict must be "approve" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise "revise" with actionable reasoning.
