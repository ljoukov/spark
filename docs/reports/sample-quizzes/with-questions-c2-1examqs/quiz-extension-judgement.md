# Sample 4: C2.1ExamQs.pdf (extraction) — Extension Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to most rubric dimensions. Question quality is high, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready. The coverage and balance of topics are excellent, incorporating a suitable mix of question types and addressing key concepts relevant to GCSE Triple Science. Difficulty alignment is also well-managed, offering a varied challenge appropriate for the specified level. Furthermore, the quiz maintains a safe and appropriate tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content. However, a minor inconsistency was noted in the answer precision for one question, requiring a revision to the explanation.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and well-phrased, making them suitable for an exam context.
- **Answer precision** — score 0.90
  - Answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the material. However, the explanation for Q23 contains a slight inconsistency where it correctly identifies 'D' as having the smallest range but then states the answer is 'A' (which corresponds to option D), creating a minor confusion that needs clarification for perfect precision.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 1.00
  - The quiz effectively covers key concepts such as stoichiometry, states of matter, particle model, and practical chemistry, with a good balance of multiple-choice, numeric, and short-answer question types. The topics are well-aligned with the GCSE Triple Science syllabus.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, ranging from foundation to higher difficulty, as indicated by the 'difficulty' tags and the cognitive demands of the tasks.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz avoids misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The tone is professional and appropriate for an educational assessment.

## Audit

- Model: gemini-2.5-pro (temperature 0.15)
- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge correctly identifies a minor point of confusion in the explanation for question Q23. The explanation correctly states that substance D has the smallest liquid range, and the provided answer is 'A'. While option 'A' correctly corresponds to substance 'D', the explanation could be clearer by explicitly stating this link. The judge's assessment that this creates a 'minor confusion that needs clarification' is accurate and their 'revise' verdict is a reasonable and defensible request for a small improvement to achieve perfect precision.
