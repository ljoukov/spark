# Sample 4: C2.1ExamQs.pdf (extraction) — Extension Slop Detection

**Model risk label:** slop
**Weighted risk:** 0.625 (threshold 0.55)
**Model confidence:** 1.00 (LLM flagged slop)
**Annoyance rating:** 4/5

## Top fixes

- (none reported)

## Axis scores

- **Density** — score 1.0
  - The multiple-choice options have redundant prefixes (e.g., 'A. A)'), which adds unnecessary clutter but does not severely impact readability.
- **Relevance** — score 0.0
  - All questions, answers, and explanations are directly relevant to the stated GCSE Chemistry topics and the provided chemical equation.
- **Factuality** — score 4.0
  - The quiz is fundamentally broken as it repeatedly references 'Figure 1' and 'Figure 2', which are not provided, making half the questions impossible to answer.
- **Bias** — score 0.0
  - The text is an objective science quiz and contains no subjective statements, unjustified opinions, or biased framing.
- **Structure** — score 3.0
  - A glaring structural flaw is the consistent, redundant formatting of all multiple-choice options (e.g., 'A. A)', 'B. B)'), indicating a rigid, flawed template.
- **Coherence** — score 3.0
  - The logical flow is severely disrupted because multiple questions depend entirely on external figures that are missing, rendering the quiz incoherent and unusable.
- **Tone** — score 1.0
  - The tone is mostly appropriate, but the redundant option formatting feels clunky, and one explanation's self-referential justification is unnatural.

## Prompt

```
You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.
Work in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.
General guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.
Rubric:
- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.
- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.
- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.
- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.
- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.
- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.
- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.
Scoring scale:
- 0 — no issue observed.
- 1 — slight issue; isolated.
- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.
- 3 — major issue across sections.
- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.
Domain weighting guidance:
- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.
- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.
- Other: average of the two profiles.
When quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).
For each axis include an auto_signals array of {"name":<metric>,"value":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.
After scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.
Return JSON only, matching the schema.

Q2: What is the chemical formula for lithium hydroxide, one of the products formed when lithium reacts with water?
Topic: Chemical reactions and equations
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall of chemical formulas from context
Answer: B) LiOH
Options:
- A. A) LiO
- B. B) LiOH
- C. C) LiH2O
- D. D) Li2O
Explanation: The chemical equation explicitly states '2LiOH' as a product, which is the formula for lithium hydroxide.

Q3: Based on Figure 1, which substance is a solid at 0 °C?
Topic: States of matter and changes of state
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Data analysis, graph interpretation
Answer: B) B
Options:
- A. A) A
- B. B) B
- C. C) C
- D. D) D
Explanation: Substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C. Since 0°C is below its melting point, substance B would be in a solid state at this temperature.
Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1

Q4: According to Figure 1, what is the approximate boiling point of substance B?
Topic: States of matter and changes of state
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Data extraction from graph
Answer: C) 190 °C
Options:
- A. A) 70 °C
- B. B) 100 °C
- C. C) 190 °C
- D. D) 200 °C
Explanation: By reading the graph for substance B, the boiling point (marked with a solid circle) is approximately 190°C.
Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1

Q5: Based on Figure 1, what is the approximate melting point of substance A?
Topic: States of matter and changes of state
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Data extraction from graph
Answer: B) -20 °C
Options:
- A. A) -100 °C
- B. B) -20 °C
- C. C) 0 °C
- D. D) 50 °C
Explanation: By reading the graph for substance A, the melting point (marked with an 'x') is approximately -20°C.
Source reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1

Q6: Suggest one reason why the student could not use the apparatus shown in Figure 2 to determine the exact melting point of substance B.
Topic: Experimental techniques, measurement accuracy
Difficulty: higher
Skill focus: Analysis of experimental design, identification of sources of error
Answer: The thermometer is placed in the water bath, not directly in substance B, meaning it measures the water temperature rather than the substance's temperature directly. OR The water bath provides indirect heating, which may not ensure uniform or precise temperature measurement of substance B.
Explanation: For an exact melting point, the thermometer should be immersed directly into the substance being measured. In Figure 2, the thermometer is in the water, which acts as a heating medium, but does not directly measure the temperature of substance B itself, leading to potential inaccuracies.
Source reference: Page 4, Question 1(f), Figure 2

Q7: What is the primary function of the water in the apparatus shown in Figure 2 when determining melting/boiling points?
Topic: Experimental techniques, heating methods
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Understanding experimental setup
Answer: C) To provide indirect and even heating
Options:
- A. A) To react with substance B
- B. B) To cool substance B
- C. C) To provide indirect and even heating
- D. D) To dissolve substance B
Explanation: A water bath is commonly used to heat substances gently and evenly. The water ensures that the substance B is heated gradually and uniformly, preventing localized overheating.

Q8: For a given material, in which state of matter are the particles typically arranged in a regular, fixed pattern?
Topic: Particle model, states of matter
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall of particle arrangement in states of matter
Answer: C) Solid
Options:
- A. A) Gas
- B. B) Liquid
- C. C) Solid
- D. D) Plasma
Explanation: In a solid, particles are closely packed in fixed positions and arranged in a regular, repeating lattice structure.
Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(b)

Q9: For a given material, in which state of matter do the particles possess the most kinetic energy?
Topic: Particle model, states of matter
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Recall of kinetic energy in states of matter
Answer: C) Gas
Options:
- A. A) Solid
- B. B) Liquid
- C. C) Gas
- D. D) Plasma
Explanation: Gas particles have the highest kinetic energy because they are far apart and move rapidly and randomly, colliding frequently with each other and the container walls.
Source reference: Page 5, Question 2(b)

Q10: A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Besides being far apart, which other characteristic of gas particle movement does this model effectively demonstrate?
Topic: Particle model, states of matter
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Understanding models, recall of gas properties
Answer: C) The particles move randomly
Options:
- A. A) The particles move slowly
- B. B) The particles are in fixed positions
- C. C) The particles move randomly
- D. D) The particles are different colours
Explanation: The shaking motion causes the balls to move in unpredictable directions and paths, accurately representing the random motion of gas particles. The study material explicitly lists 'The balls move randomly' as a good characteristic.
