# Sample 5: F503558B-56E2-4FB4-B7C9-788A6231BBA3_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Base Quiz

**Quiz title:** GCSE Chemistry: C20 Retrieval Practice
**Summary:** This quiz covers 6 key concepts from the AQA GCSE Chemistry C20 'Chemical and Allied Industries' topic. It includes questions on corrosion, alloys, the Haber process, and NPK fertilisers, with a mix of short answer and multiple-choice formats to test recall and understanding. The difficulty ranges from foundation to intermediate. Specific AQA specification points are not provided in the source material, so syllabus alignment is general to the C20 topic.

## Questions

### 1. What is corrosion?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Corrosion
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q1
- Answer: The destruction of a material through reactions with substances in the environment.

> Corrosion is a natural process that converts a refined metal into a more stable form, such as its oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide. It is the gradual destruction of materials (usually metals) by chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment.

### 2. How is rust formed?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Rusting
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q4
- Answer: Rust is formed by the reaction between iron, water, and oxygen.

> Rusting is a specific type of corrosion that affects iron and steel. It requires both oxygen and water to occur. The iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, which is commonly known as rust.

### 3. Which of the following pairs are two common alloys of copper?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Alloys
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q5
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. Brass and bronze
  - B. Steel and aluminium
  - C. Gold and silver
  - D. Iron and carbon

> Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, while bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Both are widely used due to their properties, which are often superior to pure copper.

### 4. What is the balanced symbol equation for the Haber process?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Haber Process
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall, Equation balancing
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q13
- Answer: N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) = 2NH₃(g)

> The Haber process combines nitrogen gas (N₂) from the air with hydrogen gas (H₂) derived from natural gas to produce ammonia (NH₃). The equation must be balanced to show the conservation of atoms.

### 5. What are the typical conditions used for the Haber process?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Haber Process
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall, Understanding industrial processes
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q18
- Answer: The conditions for the Haber process are 450°C, 200 atmospheres (atm) pressure, and an iron catalyst.

> These conditions are chosen as a compromise to achieve a good yield of ammonia at a reasonable rate. A higher temperature increases the rate but decreases the yield, while a higher pressure increases both yield and rate. The iron catalyst speeds up the reaction without being used up.

### 6. What is an NPK fertiliser?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Fertilisers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall, Definition
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q19
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A formulation containing soluble compounds of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.
  - B. A compound used to increase soil acidity.
  - C. A substance that kills pests on crops.
  - D. A mixture of sand, clay, and organic matter.

> NPK fertilisers are formulations containing soluble compounds of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These are essential nutrients for plant growth, each playing a vital role in different aspects of plant health and development.
