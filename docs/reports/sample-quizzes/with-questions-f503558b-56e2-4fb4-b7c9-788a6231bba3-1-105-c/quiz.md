## Questions

### 1. What is corrosion?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Metals, Corrosion
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q1
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: The destruction of a material through reactions with substances in the environment
  - B. B: The process of strengthening metals by heating and cooling
  - C. C: The formation of a protective layer on a metal surface
  - D. D: The breaking down of a material by physical forces

> Corrosion is the process where materials, typically metals, degrade due to chemical reactions with their environment, often involving oxygen and water. This leads to the destruction of the material's properties.

### 2. What is sacrificial protection?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Metals, Corrosion prevention
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall, understanding application
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q3
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: Adding a more reactive metal to the surface of a material
  - B. B: Coating a metal with paint or grease
  - C. C: Using an inert gas to prevent oxidation
  - D. D: Applying an electrical current to prevent rust

> Sacrificial protection involves connecting a more reactive metal (the sacrificial anode) to the metal to be protected. The more reactive metal corrodes preferentially, protecting the other metal from oxidation.

### 3. What are gold alloys in jewellery made from?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Alloys, Metals
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q6
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: Gold with copper, zinc, and silver
  - B. B: Gold with platinum and palladium
  - C. C: Gold with iron and carbon
  - D. D: Gold with aluminium and titanium

> Gold is often alloyed with other metals like copper, zinc, and silver to increase its hardness and durability for use in jewellery, as pure gold is very soft and easily scratched.

### 4. What is the balanced symbol equation for the Haber process?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Industrial processes, Haber process, Chemical equations
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Application of knowledge, balancing equations
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q15
- Answer: N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) = 2NH₃(g)

> The Haber process synthesises ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. The balanced equation shows one molecule of nitrogen reacting with three molecules of hydrogen to produce two molecules of ammonia, ensuring conservation of atoms.

### 5. What catalyst do we use for the Haber process?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Industrial processes, Haber process, Catalysts
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q19
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: Iron
  - B. B: Vanadium(V) oxide
  - C. C: Nickel
  - D. D: Platinum

> Iron is used as a catalyst in the Haber process to speed up the rate of reaction without being consumed, allowing the process to be economically viable at lower temperatures and pressures than would otherwise be needed.

### 6. What is an NPK fertiliser?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Fertilisers, Agriculture
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall, definition
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q21
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: A formulation containing soluble compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
  - B. B: A fertiliser made only from natural organic matter
  - C. C: A compound used to kill pests in agriculture
  - D. D: A substance that increases soil acidity

> NPK fertilisers are formulations containing soluble compounds of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These are essential macronutrients required by plants for healthy growth.
