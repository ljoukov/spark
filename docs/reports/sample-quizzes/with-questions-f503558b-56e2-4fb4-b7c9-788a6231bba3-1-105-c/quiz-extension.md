## Questions

### 1. What does the 'P' in NPK fertiliser stand for?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: NPK Fertilisers
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall chemical symbols and definitions
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q21 Answer
- Answer: B. Phosphorous
- Options:
  - A. A. Platinum
  - B. B. Phosphorous
  - C. C. Potassium
  - D. D. Polonium

> NPK fertilisers are formulations containing soluble compounds of the three essential elements for plant growth: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K).

### 2. According to the balanced equation for the Haber process, N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g), how many moles of hydrogen gas are required to react with one mole of nitrogen gas?

- Type: numeric
- Topic: Haber process
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpret balanced chemical equations
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q15 Answer
- Answer: 3

> The stoichiometry of the balanced symbol equation shows that 1 mole of nitrogen gas (N₂) reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas (H₂) to produce 2 moles of ammonia (NH₃).

### 3. True or False: According to the provided material, iron will rust if it is exposed only to oxygen.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Rusting
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall conditions for a chemical reaction
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q4 Answer
- Answer: False

> The formation of rust is a reaction that requires the presence of both oxygen and water.

### 4. Which of the following is an example of a composite material?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Composites
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Identify examples of material types
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q14 Answer
- Answer: C. Reinforced concrete
- Options:
  - A. A. Brass
  - B. B. Bricks
  - C. C. Reinforced concrete
  - D. D. Borosilicate glass

> A composite is a mixture of a matrix and reinforcements. Reinforced concrete and plywood are given as examples. Brass is an alloy and bricks are ceramics.

### 5. What is the specific temperature, in degrees Celsius, used as a compromise condition for the Haber process?

- Type: numeric
- Topic: Haber process
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall specific reaction conditions
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q20 Answer
- Answer: 450

> The compromise conditions for the Haber process are a temperature of 450°C, a pressure of 200 atm, and an iron catalyst.

### 6. Which type of polymer is characterised by not softening when it is heated?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Compare properties of materials
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q12 Answer
- Answer: A. Thermosetting polymers
- Options:
  - A. A. Thermosetting polymers
  - B. B. Thermosoftening polymers
  - C. C. Clay polymers
  - D. D. Metallic polymers

> The key difference is that thermosetting polymers do not soften upon heating, whereas thermosoftening polymers do.

### 7. Steel is an alloy made primarily from iron and which other element?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Alloys
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall the composition of an alloy
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q7 Answer
- Answer: D. Carbon
- Options:
  - A. A. Copper
  - B. B. Zinc
  - C. C. Silver
  - D. D. Carbon

> Steel alloys are made from iron, carbon, and other metals. Carbon is the key non-metal element added to iron to make steel.

### 8. What term is used to describe a substance like an NPK fertiliser, which contains a mixture of soluble compounds?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: NPK Fertilisers
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Recall and apply a key term
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q21 Answer
- Answer: a formulation

> An NPK fertiliser is defined as a formulation containing soluble compounds of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.

### 9. Which property of borosilicate glass is much higher than that of soda-lime glass, making it suitable for applications involving heat?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Glass and Ceramics
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Compare material properties
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q9 Answer
- Answer: B. Melting point
- Options:
  - A. A. Density
  - B. B. Melting point
  - C. C. Brittleness
  - D. D. Colour

> The main difference highlighted is that borosilicate glass has a much higher melting point than soda-lime glass.

### 10. Which of the following is a physical barrier method used to protect against corrosion?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Corrosion prevention
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Identify methods of prevention
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q2 Answer
- Answer: A. Paint
- Options:
  - A. A. Paint
  - B. B. Sacrificial protection
  - C. C. Alloying
  - D. D. Using a catalyst

> Physical barriers like grease, paint, or a thin layer of metal prevent substances in the environment from reacting with the material's surface.
