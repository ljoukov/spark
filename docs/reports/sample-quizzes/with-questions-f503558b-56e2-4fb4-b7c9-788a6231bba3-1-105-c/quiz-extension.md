## Questions

### 1. Which of the following is a physical barrier used to protect against corrosion?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Corrosion prevention
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q2
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: Grease, paint, or a thin layer of metal
  - B. B: Sacrificial protection using a more reactive metal
  - C. C: Alloying the metal with another element
  - D. D: Electroplating with a less reactive metal

> Physical barriers like grease, paint, or a thin layer of metal prevent oxygen and water from reaching the metal surface, thus inhibiting corrosion.

### 2. Rust is specifically formed through a reaction involving which three substances?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Corrosion, Rusting
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q4
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A: Copper, zinc, and carbon dioxide
  - B. B: Iron, water, and oxygen
  - C. C: Aluminium, nitrogen, and hydrogen
  - D. D: Steel, acid, and heat

> Rusting is the specific corrosion of iron, which requires both oxygen and water to occur.

### 3. Which pair correctly identifies two common alloys of copper?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Alloys, Copper
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q5
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A: Steel and duralumin
  - B. B: Solder and pewter
  - C. C: Brass and bronze
  - D. D: Amalgam and electrum

> Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, while bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Both are well-known copper alloys.

### 4. What are steel alloys primarily made from?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Alloys, Steel
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q7
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: Iron, carbon, and other metals
  - B. B: Aluminium, silicon, and oxygen
  - C. C: Copper, zinc, and tin
  - D. D: Gold, silver, and platinum

> Steel is an alloy of iron with a small percentage of carbon, and often other elements like chromium or nickel to impart specific properties.

### 5. A key property of aluminium alloys that makes them useful in industries like aerospace is that they generally have:

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Alloys, Aluminium
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understanding properties and uses
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q8
- Answer: D
- Options:
  - A. A: High melting points
  - B. B: Excellent electrical conductivity
  - C. C: Extreme hardness
  - D. D: Low densities

> Aluminium alloys are valued for their low density, which contributes to lightweight structures, making them ideal for aircraft and vehicles.

### 6. What is the main difference in properties between soda-lime glass and borosilicate glass?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Ceramics, Glass
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Comparing materials
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q9
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A: Soda-lime glass is more resistant to chemical attack
  - B. B: Borosilicate glass has a much higher melting point
  - C. C: Soda-lime glass is used for laboratory equipment
  - D. D: Borosilicate glass is more easily recycled

> Borosilicate glass (like Pyrex) contains boron oxide, which gives it a much higher melting point and better thermal shock resistance compared to soda-lime glass.

### 7. Which of the following pairs are examples of clay ceramics?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Ceramics, Clay
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q10
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: Pottery and bricks
  - B. B: Glass and concrete
  - C. C: Steel and aluminium
  - D. D: Plastic and rubber

> Pottery and bricks are traditional ceramics made by shaping clay and then firing it at high temperatures.

### 8. What is the key distinction between thermosetting and thermosoftening polymers when heated?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understanding material properties
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q12
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A: Thermosetting polymers can be remoulded, thermosoftening cannot
  - B. B: Thermosoftening polymers are always stronger than thermosetting polymers
  - C. C: Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated, while thermosoftening polymers do
  - D. D: Thermosetting polymers are formed from monomers, thermosoftening are not

> Thermosoftening polymers have weak intermolecular forces that allow them to soften and melt when heated, whereas thermosetting polymers form strong covalent cross-links that prevent them from softening or melting.

### 9. What is the effect of increasing the temperature in the Haber process on the yield, rate, and cost?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Haber process, Chemical equilibrium, Reaction kinetics
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Analyzing process conditions
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q17
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A: Increase yield, decrease rate, decrease cost
  - B. B: Decrease yield, increase rate, increase cost
  - C. C: Increase yield, increase rate, decrease cost
  - D. D: Decrease yield, decrease rate, increase cost

> The Haber process is an exothermic reaction, so increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing yield. However, higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of particles, leading to a faster reaction rate. Operating at higher temperatures also incurs higher energy costs.

### 10. Which set of conditions is typically used for the Haber process?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Haber process, Industrial conditions
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Knowledge recall of industrial processes
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q20
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A: 450°C, 200 atm, iron catalyst
  - B. B: 200°C, 1 atm, platinum catalyst
  - C. C: 700°C, 100 atm, vanadium(V) oxide catalyst
  - D. D: 300°C, 500 atm, nickel catalyst

> The Haber process uses a compromise temperature of around 450°C and a high pressure of 200 atmospheres, with an iron catalyst, to achieve a reasonable yield and rate economically.
