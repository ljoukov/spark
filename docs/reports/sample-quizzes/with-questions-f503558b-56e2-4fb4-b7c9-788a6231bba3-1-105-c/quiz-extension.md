## Questions

### 1. What are three physical barriers commonly used to protect against corrosion?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Corrosion Protection
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q2
- Answer: Grease, paint, and a thin layer of metal.

> Physical barriers prevent oxygen and water from reaching the metal surface, thus stopping the corrosion process. Common examples include applying grease, painting the surface, or coating it with a less reactive metal like tin or zinc.

### 2. Which of the following best describes sacrificial protection against corrosion?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Corrosion Protection
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understanding concepts
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q3
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. Applying a layer of paint to the metal surface.
  - B. B. Adding a more reactive metal to the surface of a material.
  - C. C. Using an inert gas to prevent oxygen contact.
  - D. D. Coating the metal with a less reactive metal.

> Sacrificial protection involves connecting a more reactive metal (the sacrificial anode) to the metal being protected. The more reactive metal corrodes preferentially, sacrificing itself to protect the other metal.

### 3. Gold alloys used in jewellery are typically made from gold combined with which other metals?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Alloys
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q6
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. Iron, nickel, and chromium
  - B. B. Copper, zinc, and silver
  - C. C. Aluminium, magnesium, and silicon
  - D. D. Lead, tin, and antimony

> Pure gold is very soft. To make it more durable and to alter its colour for jewellery, it is alloyed with other metals. Common alloying metals include copper, zinc, and silver.

### 4. What is a key property of aluminium alloys that makes them widely used in industries like aerospace and transport?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Alloys
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall, Application
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q8
- Answer: They generally have low densities.

> Aluminium alloys are valued for their low density, which translates to a high strength-to-weight ratio. This property is crucial for applications where weight reduction is important, such as in aircraft and vehicle manufacturing.

### 5. State the main difference in properties between soda-lime glass and borosilicate glass.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Ceramics/Glass
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Comparison, Recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q9
- Answer: Borosilicate glass has a much higher melting point (and better thermal shock resistance) compared to soda-lime glass.

> Soda-lime glass is common window and bottle glass. Borosilicate glass (like Pyrex) contains boron oxide, which gives it a higher melting point and makes it more resistant to thermal shock, making it suitable for laboratory glassware and ovenware.

### 6. Which of the following are two common examples of clay ceramics?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Ceramics
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall, Examples
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q10
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A. Steel and cast iron
  - B. B. Plywood and reinforced concrete
  - C. C. Pottery and bricks
  - D. D. Glass and plastic

> Clay ceramics are made by shaping wet clay and then firing it at high temperatures. Pottery (like earthenware and stoneware) and bricks are classic examples of products made from clay.

### 7. Explain the main difference in behaviour between thermosetting and thermosoftening polymers when heated.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Comparison, Understanding properties
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q12
- Answer: Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated, whereas thermosoftening polymers do soften when heated.

> Thermosoftening polymers have weak intermolecular forces between polymer chains, allowing them to soften and melt when heated and be reshaped. Thermosetting polymers form strong covalent cross-links between their polymer chains during formation, making them rigid and preventing them from softening or melting upon heating; they char or burn instead.

### 8. What is the definition of a composite material?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Composites
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Definition, Recall
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q15
- Answer: A composite is a mixture of a matrix and reinforcements.

> Composite materials are formed by combining two or more different materials, which remain separate and distinct at the macroscopic level within the finished structure. They typically consist of a matrix (binder) and a reinforcement material, with the aim of achieving properties superior to those of the individual components.

### 9. In the Haber process, what is the effect of increasing the temperature on the yield, rate, and cost of ammonia production?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Haber Process
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Analysis, Le Chatelier's Principle
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q17
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. Increase yield, decrease rate, decrease cost
  - B. B. Decrease yield, increase rate, increase cost
  - C. C. Increase yield, increase rate, decrease cost
  - D. D. Decrease yield, decrease rate, increase cost

> The forward reaction in the Haber process is exothermic, so increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left (reactants), decreasing the yield of ammonia. However, higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of particles, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions, thus increasing the reaction rate. Increased energy input also contributes to higher operational costs.

### 10. How does increasing the pressure affect the yield, rate, and cost of the Haber process?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Haber Process
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Analysis, Le Chatelier's Principle
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q18
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A. Increase yield, increase rate, increase cost
  - B. B. Decrease yield, decrease rate, decrease cost
  - C. C. Increase yield, decrease rate, increase cost
  - D. D. Decrease yield, increase rate, decrease cost

> The Haber process involves a decrease in the number of gas moles from reactants (1 N₂ + 3 H₂ = 4 moles) to product (2 NH₃ = 2 moles). According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing pressure shifts the equilibrium towards the side with fewer moles of gas, thus increasing the yield of ammonia. Higher pressure also increases the concentration of gas molecules, leading to more frequent collisions and a faster reaction rate. However, maintaining high pressure requires stronger equipment and more energy, increasing costs.
