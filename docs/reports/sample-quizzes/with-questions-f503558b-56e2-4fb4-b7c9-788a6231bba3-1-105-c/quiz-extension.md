## Questions

### 1. What does the 'NPK' in NPK fertiliser stand for?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Fertilisers
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall acronym
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q21
- Answer: D
- Options:
  - A. A) Nitrogen, Platinum, Krypton
  - B. B) Sodium, Phosphorus, Krypton
  - C. C) Nitrogen, Polonium, Calcium
  - D. D) Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium

> NPK fertilisers are formulations containing soluble compounds of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), which are essential nutrients for plant growth.

### 2. According to the balanced equation for the Haber process, N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g), how many moles of hydrogen gas are required to produce two moles of ammonia?

- Type: numeric
- Topic: Haber Process
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Interpret chemical equation
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q15
- Answer: 3

> The stoichiometry of the balanced symbol equation shows that 3 moles of hydrogen gas (3H₂) react with 1 mole of nitrogen gas (N₂) to produce 2 moles of ammonia (2NH₃).

### 3. Besides iron, what essential non-metal element is a key component of steel alloys?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Alloys
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall composition
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q7
- Answer: Carbon

> Steel is an alloy of iron with carbon, and often other metals are added to give specific properties.

### 4. Thermosetting polymers can be easily melted and reshaped upon heating.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Differentiate properties
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q12
- Answer: False

> Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated due to strong cross-links between the polymer chains. It is thermosoftening polymers that can be melted and reshaped.

### 5. Which of the following materials is an example of a composite?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Composites
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Identify example
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q14
- Answer: D
- Options:
  - A. A) Brass
  - B. B) Borosilicate glass
  - C. C) Steel
  - D. D) Plywood

> Plywood is a composite material, made from layers of wood veneer (reinforcement) held together by an adhesive (matrix). Brass, steel, and borosilicate glass are not composites.

### 6. What is the specific pressure used as a compromise condition for the Haber process?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Haber Process
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall specific condition
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q20
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A) 450 atm
  - B. B) 200 atm
  - C. C) 450 °C
  - D. D) 200 Pa

> The industrial conditions for the Haber process are a compromise to achieve a good yield and rate at a manageable cost. The pressure used is 200 atmospheres.

### 7. A composite material is defined as a mixture of a matrix and what other component?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Composites
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall definition component
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q13
- Answer: Reinforcements

> Composites are made of two main parts: the matrix, which surrounds and binds together the other component, known as the reinforcements (e.g., fibres or fragments).

### 8. Which type of glass is particularly suitable for laboratory use due to its high melting point?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Ceramics and Glass
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Apply property to use
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q9
- Answer: Borosilicate glass

> Borosilicate glass has a much higher melting point than soda-lime glass, making it resistant to the high temperatures and thermal shock often encountered in a laboratory.

### 9. What two substances are required, in addition to iron, for rust to form?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Corrosion
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall reactants
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q4
- Answer: Water and oxygen

> Rusting is the specific name for the corrosion of iron, and it is a chemical reaction that requires the presence of both oxygen (from the air) and water.

### 10. For the chemical compounds in an NPK fertiliser to be effective, what key property must they possess?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Fertilisers
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Explain requirement
- Source reference: C20 questions, Q21
- Answer: They must be soluble.

> The compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium must be soluble in water so that they can be absorbed by the roots of plants from the soil.
