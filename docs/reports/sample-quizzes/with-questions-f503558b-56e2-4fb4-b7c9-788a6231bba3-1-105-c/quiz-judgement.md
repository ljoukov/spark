# Sample 5: F503558B-56E2-4FB4-B7C9-788A6231BBA3_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to several rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is excellent, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and suitable for GCSE examinations. 'Answer precision' is also high, as all answers are factually correct and directly derived from the provided source material, with helpful additional explanations. The 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge from foundation recall to higher-level explanations of chemical processes. Finally, the quiz fully meets the 'Safety & tone' criteria, containing no misinformation or off-spec content and using UK English spelling. However, the 'Coverage and balance' dimension is slightly deficient due to the omission of one question (Q21) from the source image, which covers NPK fertilisers, a relevant topic for the specified syllabus. This also leads to an inaccurate statement in the quiz summary regarding coverage gaps.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and directly reflect typical GCSE exam questions, extracted accurately from the source.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - Answers are factually correct, directly grounded in the provided material, and the added explanations enhance their clarity and educational value.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.70
  - While the quiz covers key concepts from the C20 chapter, it omits question 21 on NPK fertilisers, which is present in the source image and relevant to the syllabus. This results in incomplete coverage and an inaccurate summary statement. All questions are of the 'short_answer' type, which is consistent with the source but limits the variety of question formats for a comprehensive quiz.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are well-aligned with GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge level from foundation recall to higher-order thinking, as indicated by the assigned difficulty levels.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz contains no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The language used is appropriate for the target audience and adheres to UK English spelling.

- Confidence: high

The judge correctly identifies that the candidate quiz omits question 21 from the source material, which is about NPK fertilisers. This omission justifies a score reduction for 'Coverage and balance' and supports the 'revise' verdict. However, the judge's reasoning is flawed. The judge states that the omission leads to 'an inaccurate statement in the quiz summary regarding coverage gaps'. This is incorrect. The candidate's summary explicitly and accurately states: 'Coverage gaps: NPK fertilisers are not covered.' The candidate correctly identified and declared the omission. The judge has misread the summary and penalised the candidate for being transparent, which is a significant error in the evaluation.
