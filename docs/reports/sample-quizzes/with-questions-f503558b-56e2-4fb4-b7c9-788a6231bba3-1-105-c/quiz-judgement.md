# Sample 5: F503558B-56E2-4FB4-B7C9-788A6231BBA3_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates good factual accuracy and appropriate difficulty alignment for GCSE Triple Science. However, it requires revision primarily due to significant issues with 'Question quality' regarding source referencing and 'Coverage and balance'. The quiz only includes a small fraction of the available questions from the source material, limiting its effectiveness as a comprehensive retrieval practice. Additionally, there are minor phrasing improvements needed for one multiple-choice prompt.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 0.60
  - While most prompts are precise and unambiguous, there are critical errors in the `id` and `sourceReference` fields for questions Q13, Q18, and Q19, which do not align with the actual questions from the provided image. For example, the question about the Haber equation is labelled Q13 in the quiz but is Q15 in the source. The prompt for Q5 could also be slightly rephrased for better clarity (e.g., 'Which option lists two common alloys of copper?').
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers provided are factually correct, directly grounded in the material from the source image, and use appropriate UK English spelling.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.40
  - The quiz includes only 6 out of 21 questions from the source material, which represents very limited coverage of the C20 topic. This significantly reduces its utility for comprehensive retrieval practice. While the mix of short answer and multiple-choice questions is reasonable for the number of questions included, the overall scope is too narrow.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 0.90
  - The selected questions are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with a suitable mix of foundation and intermediate difficulty levels. The individual items are well-aligned with the expected challenge for this specification.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz avoids misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The tone is appropriate for an educational resource, and UK English spelling is consistently used.

## Audit

- Model: gemini-2.5-pro (temperature 0.15)
- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict to 'revise' is appropriate and well-justified. The primary issues identified—incorrect source referencing for several questions (e.g., Q13 should be Q15, Q18 should be Q20) and very low coverage (6 out of 21 questions)—are accurate and significant. The judge's scoring across the rubric is reasonable. One minor point the judge missed under 'Answer precision' is that the candidate correctly identified and fixed a typo in the source material's answer for the Haber process equation (the source incorrectly shows '2H₂' while the candidate correctly uses '3H₂'). While the judge's justification that the answer was 'directly grounded' in the source was therefore not perfectly accurate, the answer provided by the candidate was factually correct, so the score of 1 is still defensible. This minor oversight does not change the validity of the overall verdict.

Rubric:
- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?
- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?
- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?
- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?
- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.
Use the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.
