**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is excellent, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, directly mirroring the source material. Answer precision is consistently high, with all answers factually correct and directly grounded in the provided C20 retrieval answers, including a minor but important correction of 'phosphorous' to 'phosphorus'. The quiz exhibits good coverage and balance for its length, addressing key GCSE Triple Science Chemistry C20 concepts such as corrosion, alloys, the Haber process, and fertilisers, utilising a suitable mix of multiple-choice and short-answer question types. Difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with questions ranging from foundation-level recall to higher-tier application (e.g., balancing equations). Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate safety and tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content, and uses correct UK English spelling.

## Audit

- Model: gemini-2.5-pro (temperature 0.15)
- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is entirely reasonable. The candidate quiz is of high quality, accurately extracting information from the source document. Crucially, the candidate identified and corrected two errors present in the source material: the unbalanced chemical equation for the Haber process (changing 2H₂ to the correct 3H₂) and the misspelling of 'phosphorus' as 'phosphorous'. The judge correctly identified the overall high quality and precision of the quiz, specifically noting the spelling correction, and gave a well-justified 'approve' verdict with perfect scores across all rubric criteria.
