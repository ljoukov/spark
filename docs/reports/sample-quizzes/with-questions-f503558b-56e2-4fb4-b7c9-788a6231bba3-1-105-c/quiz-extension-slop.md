## Prompt

```
You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.
Work in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.
General guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.
Rubric:
- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.
- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.
- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.
- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.
- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.
- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.
- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.
Scoring scale:
- 0 — no issue observed.
- 1 — slight issue; isolated.
- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.
- 3 — major issue across sections.
- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.
Domain weighting guidance:
- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.
- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.
- Other: average of the two profiles.
When quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).
For each axis include an auto_signals array of {"name":<metric>,"value":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.
After scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.
Return JSON only, matching the schema.

Q1: Which of the following is a physical barrier used to protect against corrosion?
Topic: Corrosion prevention
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Knowledge recall
Answer: A
Options:
- A. A: Grease, paint, or a thin layer of metal
- B. B: Sacrificial protection using a more reactive metal
- C. C: Alloying the metal with another element
- D. D: Electroplating with a less reactive metal
Explanation: Physical barriers like grease, paint, or a thin layer of metal prevent oxygen and water from reaching the metal surface, thus inhibiting corrosion.

- C. C: Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated, while thermosoftening polymers do
- D. D: Thermosetting polymers are formed from monomers, thermosoftening are not
Explanation: Thermosoftening polymers have weak intermolecular forces that allow them to soften and melt when heated, whereas thermosetting polymers form strong covalent cross-links that prevent them from softening or melting.

Q9: What is the effect of increasing the temperature in the Haber process on the yield, rate, and cost?
Topic: Haber process, Chemical equilibrium, Reaction kinetics
Difficulty: higher
Skill focus: Analyzing process conditions
Answer: B
Options:
- A. A: Increase yield, decrease rate, decrease cost
- B. B: Decrease yield, increase rate, increase cost
- C. C: Increase yield, increase rate, decrease cost
- D. D: Decrease yield, decrease rate, increase cost
Explanation: The Haber process is an exothermic reaction, so increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing yield. However, higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of particles, leading to a faster reaction rate. Operating at higher temperatures also incurs higher energy costs.
Source reference: C20 questions, Q17

Q10: Which set of conditions is typically used for the Haber process?
Topic: Haber process, Industrial conditions
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Knowledge recall of industrial processes
Answer: A

- C. C: 700°C, 100 atm, vanadium(V) oxide catalyst
- D. D: 300°C, 500 atm, nickel catalyst
Explanation: The Haber process uses a compromise temperature of around 450°C and a high pressure of 200 atmospheres, with an iron catalyst, to achieve a reasonable yield and rate economically.
