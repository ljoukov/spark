- Confidence: high

The judge correctly identifies this as a high-quality quiz that adheres to all rubric dimensions. The questions are well-formed, cover the source material effectively, and use a good variety of formats. The judge's verdict to approve is appropriate. There is a minor nuance the judge missed: the source material contains a factual error in the balanced equation for the Haber process (Q15 in the source lists '2H₂' instead of the correct '3H₂'). The candidate cleverly handles this in Q22 by providing the scientifically correct equation within the prompt, thus testing the skill of interpreting the equation rather than recalling an error. The judge's statement that all answers are 'directly grounded in the provided source material' is therefore not strictly accurate for this question, but the candidate's approach is commendable and improves the quiz. This minor oversight in the judge's reasoning does not change the correctness of the final verdict.
