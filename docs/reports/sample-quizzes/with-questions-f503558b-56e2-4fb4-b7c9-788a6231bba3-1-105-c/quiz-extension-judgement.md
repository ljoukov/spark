**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is high, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, effectively building upon the original source material. 'Answer precision' is consistently strong, providing factually correct and well-justified responses that are directly grounded in the material. The 'Coverage and balance' are commendable, addressing key concepts from the C20 'Chemical and Allied Industries' topic with a suitable mix of short answer and multiple-choice questions. 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge from foundation recall to higher-level analytical questions, particularly in the Haber process section. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are maintained throughout, with no misinformation or off-spec content, and correct UK English spelling.
