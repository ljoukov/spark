# Sample 5: F503558B-56E2-4FB4-B7C9-788A6231BBA3_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Extension Quality Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The quiz demonstrates strong adherence to `Question quality` and `Answer precision`, with prompts that are clear, unambiguous, and factually correct, directly aligning with the provided source material. The `Difficulty alignment` is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge. Furthermore, the `Safety & tone` are excellent, with no off-spec or harmful content. However, the quiz falls short in `Coverage and balance` due to significant inaccuracies in its `summary` and `mode` fields, which misrepresent the quiz's content and structure.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and well-phrased for an exam context, effectively converting the original retrieval questions into multiple-choice format.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers are factually correct, directly grounded in the provided source material, and accompanied by accurate and concise explanations.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.50
  - While the topics covered are relevant to GCSE Triple Science C20, the quiz's 'summary' inaccurately states the question count (16 vs 10), claims the inclusion of a short-answer question (when all are multiple-choice), and incorrectly describes the questions as 'new' and 'exploring fresh angles' when they are direct conversions of existing retrieval questions. The 'mode' as 'extension' is also misleading given this context.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with a good mix of foundation, intermediate, and higher-level challenge, particularly evident in the Haber process questions.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz contains no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The tone is appropriate for an educational resource, and UK English spelling is consistently used.

## Audit

- Model: gemini-2.5-pro (temperature 0.15)
- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The judge correctly identifies that while the questions and answers are high quality and factually correct based on the source material, the quiz's metadata contains significant errors. The `summary` misstates the number of questions (claiming 16 when there are 10), incorrectly claims a short-answer question is included, and falsely describes the questions as 'new' and the quiz as an 'extension' when they are direct conversions from the source. These inaccuracies fully justify the low score for 'Coverage and balance' and the overall 'revise' verdict.
