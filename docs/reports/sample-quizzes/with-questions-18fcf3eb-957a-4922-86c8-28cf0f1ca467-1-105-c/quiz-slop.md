## Prompt

```
You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.
Work in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.
General guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.
Rubric:
- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.
- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.
- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.
- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.
- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.
- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.
- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.
Scoring scale:
- 0 — no issue observed.
- 1 — slight issue; isolated.
- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.
- 3 — major issue across sections.
- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.
Domain weighting guidance:
- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.
- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.
- Other: average of the two profiles.
When quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).
For each axis include an auto_signals array of {"name":<metric>,"value":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.
After scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.
Return JSON only, matching the schema.

Q1: What is an atom?
Topic: Atomic Structure
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: The smallest part of an element that can exist.
Explanation: An atom is the fundamental building block of matter, defined as the smallest particle of a chemical element that retains its chemical identity.
Source reference: C1 questions, Q1

Q2: Which of the following best describes the plum pudding model of the atom?
Topic: Atomic Models
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Understanding
Answer: A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
Options:
- A. A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
- B. A dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it in fixed energy levels.
- C. Solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
- D. A central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with electrons in shells.
Explanation: The plum pudding model, proposed by J.J. Thomson, depicted the atom as a uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered within it, like plums in a pudding.

Q3: What key discovery did Niels Bohr make regarding atomic structure?
Topic: Atomic Models
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels (shells).
Explanation: Bohr's model proposed that electrons exist in specific orbits or shells around the nucleus, each with a distinct energy level, explaining the stability of atoms and their emission spectra.
Source reference: C1 questions, Q6

Q4: What are the relative charges of a proton, neutron, and electron, respectively?
Topic: Sub-atomic Particles
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: Proton: +1, Neutron: 0, Electron: -1
Options:
- A. Proton: +1, Neutron: 0, Electron: -1
- B. Proton: 0, Neutron: +1, Electron: -1
- C. Proton: +1, Neutron: -1, Electron: 0
- D. Proton: -1, Neutron: 0, Electron: +1
Explanation: Protons carry a relative charge of +1, neutrons are neutral with a relative charge of 0, and electrons carry a relative charge of -1.
Source reference: C1 questions, Q10

Q5: Define isotopes.
Topic: Isotopes
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Understanding
Answer: Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) with different numbers of neutrons.
Explanation: Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which have different numbers of neutrons, and therefore different mass numbers, but the same number of protons.
Source reference: C1 questions, Q18

Q6: Which of the following lists four physical processes used to separate mixtures?
Topic: Separation Techniques
Difficulty: higher
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: Filtration, crystallisation, distillation, chromatography
Options:
- A. Filtration, crystallisation, distillation, chromatography
- B. Combustion, neutralisation, electrolysis, precipitation
- C. Melting, boiling, freezing, condensation
- D. Oxidation, reduction, displacement, decomposition
Explanation: Filtration separates insoluble solids from liquids. Crystallisation separates a soluble solid from a solution. Distillation separates liquids with different boiling points or a soluble solid from a liquid. Chromatography separates substances based on their differential partitioning between a stationary and a mobile phase.
