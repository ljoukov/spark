## Top fixes

- (none reported)

## Axis scores

- **Density** — score 1.0
  - Mostly concise, but isolated phrases like "an uncharged particle" in Q4 add redundant information already implied by the context of discovering the neutron.
  - Spans:
    - [2008, 2029) “an uncharged particle,”
- **Relevance** — score 0.0
  - The quiz questions are all highly relevant to the stated topic of atomic structure. The misleading title is addressed under Factuality.
- **Factuality** — score 1.0
  - The quiz title includes "Separation Techniques," but the quiz contains no questions on this topic, making the title factually inaccurate regarding the document's content.
  - Spans:
    - [42, 65) “and Separation Techniques”
- **Bias** — score 0.0
  - The text is a factual quiz with objective questions and answers. It displays no bias or unjustified subjectivity.
- **Structure** — score 3.0
  - A glaring, repetitive formatting error ("A. A.", "B. B.") plagues every multiple-choice question. Additionally, Q10 provides a full-sentence answer instead of the option letter.
  - Spans:
    - [746, 752) “- A. A.”
    - [4208, 4290) “Answer: Up to 2 in the first shell and up to 8 in the second and third shells.”
- **Coherence** — score 1.0
  - The quiz is mostly coherent, but Q10 presents a full-sentence answer before listing multiple-choice options, which is inconsistent with the format and disrupts the flow.
  - Spans:
    - [4208, 4316) “Answer: Up to 2 in the first shell and up to 8 in the second and third shells.
Options:
- A. A. 2, 8, 8”
- **Tone** — score 0.0
  - The language is clear, formal, and perfectly suited for its purpose as a GCSE chemistry quiz, aiding comprehension without being overly complex or simplistic.

## Prompt

```
You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.
Work in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.
General guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.
Rubric:
- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.
- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.
- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.
- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.
- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.
- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.
- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.
Scoring scale:
- 0 — no issue observed.
- 1 — slight issue; isolated.
- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.
- 3 — major issue across sections.
- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.
Domain weighting guidance:
- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.
- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.
- Other: average of the two profiles.
When quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).
For each axis include an auto_signals array of {"name":<metric>,"value":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.
After scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.
Return JSON only, matching the schema.

Q1: According to Dalton's model, what was the fundamental nature of atoms?
Topic: Atomic Models
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: Atoms were solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
Options:
- A. A. Atoms were solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
- B. B. Atoms consisted of a positive sphere with electrons embedded within it.
- C. C. Atoms had a dense, positively charged nucleus with electrons orbiting it.
- D. D. Atoms were composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons in distinct energy levels.
Explanation: John Dalton's atomic theory proposed that atoms were indivisible, indestructible solid spheres, and that all atoms of a given element were identical.

Q2: The alpha scattering experiment, conducted by Rutherford and his team, led to which significant discovery about atomic structure?
Topic: Atomic Models, Experimental Evidence
Difficulty: higher
Skill focus: Understanding
Answer: An atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small, dense nucleus.

- C. C. An atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small, dense nucleus.
- D. D. The atom is a sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded.

Q7: How can you determine the number of protons in an atom of a specific element?
Topic: Atomic Number, Periodic Table
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: By referring to the atomic number on the Periodic Table.
Explanation: The atomic number (Z) of an element, found on the Periodic Table, directly corresponds to the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element.

Q8: Explain how to calculate the number of neutrons in an atom, given its mass number and atomic number.
Topic: Atomic Structure, Mass Number
Difficulty: intermediate

Answer: Subtract the atomic number from the mass number.
Explanation: The mass number (A) represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. By subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number, you get the number of neutrons.
Source reference: C1 questions, Q12

Q9: Why do atoms typically have no overall electrical charge?
Topic: Atomic Structure, Charge Balance
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Understanding
Answer: They contain equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.
Options:
- A. A. They only contain neutrons, which are neutral.
- B. B. They contain equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.
- C. C. The positive charge of the nucleus is cancelled out by the negative charge of the neutrons.
- D. D. Electrons are uncharged when in fixed energy levels.
Explanation: In a neutral atom, the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus, resulting in a net charge of zero.
Source reference: C1 questions, Q13
