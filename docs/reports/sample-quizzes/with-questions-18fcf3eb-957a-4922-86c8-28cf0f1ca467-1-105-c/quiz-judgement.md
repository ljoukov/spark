## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and well-phrased for GCSE-level assessment. The slight rephrasing of Q20 from 'relative mass' to 'relative atomic mass' enhances precision.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers are factually correct and directly correspond to the information presented in the source material. Explanations provided for each answer further clarify the concepts accurately.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.90
  - The quiz provides comprehensive coverage of atomic structure, historical models, sub-atomic particles, elements, compounds, mixtures, and separation techniques, aligning well with the C1 topic. While all questions are short-answer, this is consistent with the format of the source material, and the variety in 'skillFocus' compensates for the lack of question type diversity.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are appropriately challenging for GCSE Triple Science students, with a good distribution across foundation, intermediate, and higher difficulty levels. The assignment of difficulty levels is accurate for the content covered.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz contains no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The language used is appropriate for the target audience and adheres to UK English spelling conventions.

The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The candidate quiz is a faithful and high-quality extraction of the source material. The judge correctly notes that the quiz adheres to all rubric dimensions, including question quality, answer precision, and difficulty alignment. The judge's score of 0.9 for Coverage and Balance is a reasonable and nuanced assessment, acknowledging that while the quiz only contains one question type (short-answer), this is a direct result of the source material's format, and the quiz still covers a wide range of topics and skills. The judge also correctly identified the candidate's beneficial clarification in Q20, changing "relative mass" to "relative atomic mass". The overall approval is fully justified.
