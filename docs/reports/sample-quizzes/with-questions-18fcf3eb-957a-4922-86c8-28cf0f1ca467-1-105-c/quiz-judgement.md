# Sample 2: 18FCF3EB-957A-4922-86C8-28CF0F1CA467_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong 'Question quality' with precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready prompts. 'Answer precision' is excellent, as all answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the provided source material. The 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable mix of foundation and intermediate challenge levels. Furthermore, the quiz adheres to 'Safety & tone' guidelines, avoiding misinformation and using UK English spelling. However, the 'Coverage and balance' could be improved. While the quiz covers atomic structure and compounds well, it falls short of its stated summary goal to include 'definitions of elements, compounds, and mixtures' by omitting explicit questions on elements and mixtures. Additionally, other fundamental C1 concepts present in the source, such as isotopes and relative mass, are not included, leading to a less comprehensive coverage than ideal.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and phrased in an exam-ready manner, directly reflecting the style expected at GCSE level.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - Every answer provided is factually correct and accurately reflects the information presented in the source material, with clear and concise explanations.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.70
  - The quiz provides a good mix of question types (MCQ and short answer) and covers key aspects of atomic structure and the definition of a compound. However, it lacks questions on elements, mixtures, isotopes, and relative mass, which are present in the source material and mentioned in the quiz summary, thus not fully covering the stated scope.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are well-aligned with the expected knowledge and understanding for GCSE Triple Science, with a suitable variation in challenge from foundation-level recall to intermediate-level explanation.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz contains no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content. The tone is appropriate for an educational context, and UK English spelling is consistently used.

- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The primary justification for the 'revise' verdict is the score for 'Coverage and balance', which the judge correctly identifies as a weakness. The candidate quiz's summary explicitly states it will cover 'definitions of elements, compounds, and mixtures', but it only includes a question about compounds, omitting questions on elements and mixtures which are present in the source material (Q15 and Q17). The judge also correctly notes that other relevant topics from the source, like isotopes and relative mass, are missing. This discrepancy between the stated scope in the summary and the actual content of the quiz makes the 'revise' verdict appropriate.
