# Sample 2: 18FCF3EB-957A-4922-86C8-28CF0F1CA467_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is consistently high, with precise and unambiguous prompts suitable for GCSE level. Answer precision is excellent, with all answers factually correct and directly derived from the provided source material. The difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range from foundation to higher. Furthermore, the quiz maintains a safe and appropriate tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content. While coverage of atomic structure is comprehensive, the balance could be slightly improved by including one more question on separation techniques or related concepts to better represent the 'Purity, mixtures and formulations' section of the syllabus, though this is a minor point for a short quiz.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, directly reflecting the style and content expected at GCSE level.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - Every answer is factually correct, directly grounded in the provided material, and accurately explains the concepts. Multiple-choice options are well-constructed with plausible distractors.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.80
  - The quiz covers key concepts from atomic structure comprehensively and introduces separation techniques. It includes a good mix of short-answer and multiple-choice questions. However, with 5 questions on atomic structure and only 1 on separation techniques, the balance between the two main syllabus areas could be slightly more even for a broader representation of C1 content.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are well-aligned with GCSE Triple Science difficulty, ranging from foundation recall to intermediate understanding and higher-level application, providing varied challenge.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz avoids misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content, and uses appropriate UK English spelling and terminology.

- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's assessment is excellent. The verdict to 'approve' is correct as the candidate quiz is of high quality, accurately extracting questions and answers from the provided source material. The judge's reasoning is sound, particularly in the 'Coverage and balance' section. The judge correctly identifies that the quiz is heavily weighted towards atomic structure (5 questions) versus separation techniques (1 question) and appropriately deducts a small amount from the score, while also acknowledging this is a minor point for a short quiz. This demonstrates a nuanced and accurate application of the rubric.
