# Sample 2: 18FCF3EB-957A-4922-86C8-28CF0F1CA467_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Extension Judge

**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and clearly exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is consistently accurate, with all answers factually correct and directly grounded in the provided C1 revision material. The 'Coverage and balance' are well-maintained, addressing key concepts from atomic structure, historical models, elements, compounds, mixtures, isotopes, electron shells, and separation techniques, with a suitable mix of question types (multiple choice, true/false, numeric, short answer). 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge from foundation to higher-tier questions, suitable for an extension quiz. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are impeccable, with no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content, and correct UK English spelling.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00

- **Coverage and balance** — score 1.00
  - The quiz effectively covers key concepts from the C1 Atomic Structure topic, including sub-atomic particles, atomic models, classification of matter, isotopes, electron shells, and separation techniques. There is a good balance of question types (MCQ, True/False, Numeric, Short Answer).
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with a suitable variation in challenge from foundation to higher-tier, aligning well with the 'extension' nature of the quiz. Higher-tier questions require synthesis and deeper understanding.

- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's assessment is thorough and accurate. The candidate's quiz successfully fulfills the 'extension' brief by creating a new set of questions that test the source material in different ways (e.g., multiple choice, true/false, numeric input) and require synthesis of information from multiple points in the source (e.g., Q22, Q30). The judge correctly identifies the high quality of the questions, the factual accuracy of the answers, the balanced coverage of topics, and the appropriate difficulty alignment for a GCSE extension quiz. The justifications for each rubric score are sound and well-supported by the candidate's submission. I fully concur with the 'approve' verdict.
