**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent adherence to the rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is consistently high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and clearly exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is faultless, as all answers are factually correct, well-explained, and directly grounded in the relevant scientific principles. The 'Coverage and balance' are commendable, offering a suitable mix of question types (multiple-choice, numeric, true/false, short answer) and effectively addressing key concepts within atomic structure, historical models, and properties of matter. Furthermore, the 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with a good spread of foundation, intermediate, and higher-level questions. Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate 'Safety & tone', free from misinformation or off-spec content, and uses correct UK English spelling.
