# Sample 2: 18FCF3EB-957A-4922-86C8-28CF0F1CA467_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Extension Quality Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The quiz demonstrates strong "Question quality" with precise and unambiguous prompts, and "Answer precision" with factually correct and well-explained answers. The "Difficulty alignment" is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge. Furthermore, the quiz adheres to "Safety & tone" guidelines, avoiding any misinformation or off-spec content. However, the quiz falls short on "Coverage and balance" as it exclusively focuses on atomic structure and sub-atomic particles, neglecting key concepts related to elements, compounds, mixtures, isotopes, and separation techniques, which are present in the source material (C1 questions 15-20) and explicitly mentioned in the syllabus alignment (4.2.1 Purity, mixtures and formulations).

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, suitable for GCSE level.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers are factually correct, directly grounded in the material, and accompanied by clear, accurate explanations.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.50
  - While the atomic structure topics are well-covered, the quiz completely omits questions on elements, compounds, mixtures, isotopes, and separation techniques, despite these being present in the source material (C1 questions 15-20) and explicitly listed in the syllabus alignment (4.2.1 Purity, mixtures and formulations). This creates a significant imbalance in coverage.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The items are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with a suitable and varied range of difficulty levels (foundation, intermediate, higher).
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz avoids misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content, and uses appropriate UK English spelling and tone.

## Audit

- Model: gemini-2.5-pro (temperature 0.15)
- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is entirely correct. The candidate quiz, despite its title including "Separation Techniques" and its syllabus alignment referencing "Purity, mixtures and formulations", completely fails to include any questions on these topics. The quiz exclusively draws from the first half of the source material (questions 1-14 on atomic structure) and ignores the second half (questions 15-20 on elements, compounds, mixtures, isotopes, and separation techniques). The judge accurately identifies this significant failure in coverage and balance, while correctly assessing the high quality of the questions that were included. The 'revise' verdict is therefore well-justified.

## Prompt

```
You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.
Rubric:
- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?
- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?
- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?
- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?
- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.
Use the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.
Return JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.
verdict must be "approve" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise "revise" with actionable reasoning.
Provide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.
