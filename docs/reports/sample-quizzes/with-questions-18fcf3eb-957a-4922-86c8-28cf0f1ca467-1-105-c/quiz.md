## Questions

### 1. What is an atom?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q1
- Answer: The smallest part of an element that can exist.

> An atom is the fundamental building block of matter, defined as the smallest particle of a chemical element that retains its chemical identity.

### 2. Which of the following best describes the plum pudding model of the atom?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Models
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understanding
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q3
- Answer: A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
- Options:
  - A. A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
  - B. A dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it in fixed energy levels.
  - C. Solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
  - D. A central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with electrons in shells.

> The plum pudding model, proposed by J.J. Thomson, depicted the atom as a uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered within it, like plums in a pudding.

### 3. What key discovery did Niels Bohr make regarding atomic structure?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Models
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q6
- Answer: Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels (shells).

> Bohr's model proposed that electrons exist in specific orbits or shells around the nucleus, each with a distinct energy level, explaining the stability of atoms and their emission spectra.

### 4. What are the relative charges of a proton, neutron, and electron, respectively?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Sub-atomic Particles
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q10
- Answer: Proton: +1, Neutron: 0, Electron: -1
- Options:
  - A. Proton: +1, Neutron: 0, Electron: -1
  - B. Proton: 0, Neutron: +1, Electron: -1
  - C. Proton: +1, Neutron: -1, Electron: 0
  - D. Proton: -1, Neutron: 0, Electron: +1

> Protons carry a relative charge of +1, neutrons are neutral with a relative charge of 0, and electrons carry a relative charge of -1.

### 5. Define isotopes.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Isotopes
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understanding
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q18
- Answer: Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) with different numbers of neutrons.

> Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which have different numbers of neutrons, and therefore different mass numbers, but the same number of protons.

### 6. Which of the following lists four physical processes used to separate mixtures?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Separation Techniques
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q19
- Answer: Filtration, crystallisation, distillation, chromatography
- Options:
  - A. Filtration, crystallisation, distillation, chromatography
  - B. Combustion, neutralisation, electrolysis, precipitation
  - C. Melting, boiling, freezing, condensation
  - D. Oxidation, reduction, displacement, decomposition

> Filtration separates insoluble solids from liquids. Crystallisation separates a soluble solid from a solution. Distillation separates liquids with different boiling points or a soluble solid from a liquid. Chromatography separates substances based on their differential partitioning between a stationary and a mobile phase.
