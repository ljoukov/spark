## Questions

### 1. What is an atom?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Define
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q1
- Answer: The smallest part of an element that can exist.

> Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter, retaining the chemical properties of an element.

### 2. Which of the following best describes the plum pudding model of the atom?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Models
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Describe, Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q3
- Answer: A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
- Options:
  - A. A. A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
  - B. B. A dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it in fixed energy levels.
  - C. C. Solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
  - D. D. A central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with electrons in shells.

> J.J. Thomson proposed the plum pudding model, where the atom was a uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered within it, like plums in a pudding.

### 3. What significant discovery did Niels Bohr make regarding the structure of the atom?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Models (Bohr)
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q6
- Answer: Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels (shells).
- Options:
  - A. A. The existence of an uncharged particle called the neutron.
  - B. B. That atoms are solid spheres that cannot be divided.
  - C. C. Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels (shells).
  - D. D. The atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small nucleus.

> Niels Bohr refined the nuclear model by proposing that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, fixed energy levels or shells, and can move between these shells by absorbing or emitting energy.

### 4. State the relative mass of each sub-atomic particle: proton, neutron, and electron.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Sub-atomic Particles
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q9
- Answer: Proton: 1, Neutron: 1, Electron: 0 (very small).

> Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, defined as a relative mass of 1. Electrons are significantly lighter, with a relative mass considered negligible (0) in most calculations.

### 5. Explain why atoms have no overall electrical charge.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q13
- Answer: Atoms have equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.

> In a neutral atom, the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus is exactly balanced by the number of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus, resulting in a net charge of zero.

### 6. What is a compound?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Elements, Compounds, Mixtures
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Define
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q16
- Answer: A substance made of more than one type of atom chemically joined together.
- Options:
  - A. A. A substance made of only one type of atom.
  - B. B. Two or more substances not chemically combined.
  - C. C. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
  - D. D. A substance made of more than one type of atom chemically joined together.

> A compound is formed when two or more different elements are chemically bonded together in fixed proportions. This chemical bonding distinguishes compounds from mixtures.
