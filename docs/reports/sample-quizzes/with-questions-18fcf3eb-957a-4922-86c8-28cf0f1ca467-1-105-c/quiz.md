## Questions

### 1. What is an atom?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Define key term
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q1
- Answer: The smallest part of an element that can exist.

> An atom is the fundamental unit of a chemical element, defined as the smallest particle that can still be recognised as that element.

### 2. What is Dalton's model of the atom?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Describe scientific model
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q2
- Answer: Atoms as solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.

> John Dalton's early atomic theory proposed that atoms were indivisible, solid spheres, a foundational concept in the history of atomic models.

### 3. What is the plum pudding model of the atom?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Describe scientific model
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q3
- Answer: A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.

### 4. What did scientists discover in the alpha scattering experiment?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: History of the Atom

- Source reference: C1 questions, Q4
- Answer: Some alpha particles were deflected by the gold foil. This showed that an atom's mass and positive charge must be concentrated in one small space (the nucleus).

> The deflection of alpha particles in Rutherford's experiment led to the discovery of the nucleus, showing the atom is mostly empty space with a small, dense, positively charged centre.

- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Describe scientific model

> The nuclear model, which replaced the plum pudding model, describes a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting this nucleus.

### 6. What did Niels Bohr discover?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: intermediate

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: intermediate

### 8. Where are protons and neutrons found in an atom?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall particle location

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Apply formula
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q12
- Answer: Mass number - atomic number.

> The number of neutrons is found by subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number (total number of protons and neutrons).

### 13. Why do atoms have no overall charge?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Explain concept
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q13
- Answer: They have equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.

> An atom is electrically neutral because it contains the same number of positively charged protons as negatively charged electrons, so their charges cancel out.

## Prompt

```
You are Spark's GCSE Triple Science quiz builder. Work strictly from the supplied study material.
The material already includes questions and answers. Extract high-quality exam-ready items.
Preserve original wording as much as possible while fixing small typos.
When the source already asks questions, transcribe every numbered task and sub-part. If an answer is missing, infer a correct one directly from the source material.
If the source is mostly notes with few (three or fewer) questions, keep any explicit questions first and then create additional items that still mirror the lesson content.
Never drop a question or answer that appears in the source. Expand multi-part tasks only when necessary to keep prompt, answer, and marking points aligned.
Represent the full breadth of the source. Include every major concept, definition, worked example, or sub-question that appears.
If you must merge short sub-parts to fit the questionCount, retain their core ideas and cite all relevant source references.
When the source lists numbered exam questions, cover every numbered item and its sub-parts—combine them into one prompt only when the combined question still requires every original answer.
Always write in UK English and reference the specification where relevant.
You must return exactly 20 questions.
Prioritise coverage breadth over repetition. If the source has more material than fits, select items so every key theme is still assessed.
Summaries and field values must never claim coverage that the questions do not provide; explicitly note any unavoidable omissions.
Return JSON that matches the provided schema. Field guidance:
- quizTitle: Concise, exam-style title for the quiz.
- summary: Two sentences. Sentence one states the scope, question types, and syllabus link. Sentence two must begin with "Coverage gaps:" and either say "none – full coverage achieved." or list the specific missing topics/processes.
- mode: Set to the provided mode value.
- subject: Copy the provided subject exactly.
- board: Copy the provided exam board exactly.
- syllabusAlignment: Brief note (<120 chars) naming the GCSE Triple Science topic or module.
- questionCount: Must equal the number of questions returned.
- questions: Array of question objects defined below.
Each question object must include:
- id: Match the original question identifier when present (e.g., "Q1a"). Otherwise use sequential IDs ("Q1", "Q2", ...).
- prompt: Clean exam-ready wording that still mirrors the source task.
- answer: Correct, concise answer text.
- explanation: One to two sentences justifying the answer with source evidence.
- type: One of multiple_choice, short_answer, true_false, or numeric.
- options: Only for multiple_choice. Provide exactly four answer texts without prefixing letters—the system adds labels.
- topic: Short topic label (e.g., "Atomic structure").
- difficulty: Use foundation, intermediate, or higher.
- skillFocus: Action-oriented description of the assessed skill (e.g., "Interpret data", "Explain process").
- sourceReference: Precise citation (page, question number, or caption) so humans can trace the origin. Do not fabricate references.
- Always correct typographical or scientific errors from the source (e.g., prefer the standard UK spelling "phosphorus" even if the source writes "phosphorous").
- Keep prompts, requested counts, and answers aligned. If a question asks for a specific number of items, return exactly that many in the answer after choosing the most representative examples, or adjust the prompt text so the count and answer match.
- Tighten ambiguous wording when needed so the scientific term is explicit (e.g., say "relative atomic mass" rather than the vague "relative mass").
Subject focus: chemistry.
Exam board context: AQA.
Include concise sourceReference entries when you can identify page numbers, prompts or captions.
If the material lacks enough detail for a requirement, explain the limitation in the summary.
Verify that ids and sourceReference values align with the original numbering before returning the JSON.
