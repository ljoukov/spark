## Questions

### 1. Which conclusion was drawn directly from the observation that some alpha particles were deflected by the gold foil in the alpha scattering experiment?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Interpret experimental evidence
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q4
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A. The existence of electrons.
  - B. B. The atom is mostly empty space.
  - C. C. The atom's positive charge is concentrated in a small nucleus.
  - D. D. The existence of neutrons.

> The deflection of positively charged alpha particles showed that they were being repelled by a concentrated positive charge within the atom. This led to the nuclear model, where the positive charge and mass are located in a small, dense nucleus.

### 2. Two atoms are isotopes of the same element. Which statement correctly describes the difference between them?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Apply definition
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q18
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. They have a different number of protons.
  - B. B. They have a different number of neutrons.
  - C. C. They have a different number of electrons.
  - D. D. They have a different atomic number.

> Isotopes are defined as atoms of the same element (so they must have the same number of protons) but with different numbers of neutrons, which results in a different mass number.

### 3. An atom has a mass number of 35 and an atomic number of 17. How many neutrons does it have?

- Type: numeric
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Calculation
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q12
- Answer: 18

> The number of neutrons is calculated by subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number (number of protons + neutrons). So, 35 - 17 = 18 neutrons.

### 4. What is the key difference between the plum pudding model and the later nuclear model of the atom?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Compare and contrast models
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q3, Q5
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. The plum pudding model includes neutrons, but the nuclear model does not.
  - B. B. The nuclear model has a central nucleus, while the plum pudding model has charge spread throughout.
  - C. C. The plum pudding model has electrons in fixed shells, while the nuclear model does not.
  - D. D. The nuclear model describes atoms as indivisible spheres.

> The plum pudding model described a 'sphere of positive charge' with electrons embedded, whereas the nuclear model, based on the alpha scattering experiment, proposed that the positive charge was concentrated in a central nucleus.

### 5. A compound is formed when two or more substances are mixed together but are not chemically bonded. True or False?

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Elements, Compounds and Mixtures
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Distinguish between key terms
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q16, Q17
- Answer: False

> This statement describes a mixture. A compound is a substance made of more than one type of atom that are chemically joined together.

### 6. If a neutral atom loses one electron, what is the overall charge of the resulting particle?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Apply concept of charge
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q10, Q13
- Answer: Positive (+1)

> A neutral atom has an equal number of positive protons and negative electrons. Losing one negative electron leaves an excess of one positive proton, resulting in an overall positive charge.

### 7. Which of the following is a physical process used to separate mixtures?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Separation Techniques
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall examples
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q19
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A. Combustion
  - B. B. Neutralisation
  - C. C. Crystallisation
  - D. D. Polymerisation

> Filtration, crystallisation, distillation, and chromatography are all physical processes used for separating mixtures. Combustion, neutralisation and polymerisation are chemical reactions.

### 8. Explain why the relative atomic mass of an element is rarely a whole number.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Explain a complex concept
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q18, Q20
- Answer: Because it is the average mass of all the atoms of an element, taking into account the different masses and abundances of its isotopes.

> Most elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, which are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons (and thus different masses). The relative atomic mass is a weighted average of these isotopic masses.

### 9. The discovery that an atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a nucleus was a result of which key experiment?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Link experiment to discovery
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q4
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. Dalton's solid sphere experiments
  - B. B. The alpha scattering experiment
  - C. C. Bohr's energy level experiments
  - D. D. Chadwick's neutron discovery experiments

> The alpha scattering experiment, where alpha particles were fired at gold foil, showed that some particles were deflected, leading to the conclusion that the atom has a small, dense, positive nucleus.

### 10. An atom has 11 electrons. State its electronic configuration by listing the number of electrons in each shell, starting from the first shell.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Electron Configuration
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Apply rules of electron configuration
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q14
- Answer: 2,8,1

> Electrons fill shells starting with the one closest to the nucleus. The first shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, the second can hold a maximum of 8, and the third can also hold up to 8. Therefore, 11 electrons are arranged as 2 in the first shell, 8 in the second, and the remaining 1 in the third.
