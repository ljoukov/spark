## Questions

### 1. According to Dalton's model, what was the fundamental nature of atoms?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Models
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q2
- Answer: Atoms were solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
- Options:
  - A. A. Atoms were solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
  - B. B. Atoms consisted of a positive sphere with electrons embedded within it.
  - C. C. Atoms had a dense, positively charged nucleus with electrons orbiting it.
  - D. D. Atoms were composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons in distinct energy levels.

> John Dalton's atomic theory proposed that atoms were indivisible, indestructible solid spheres, and that all atoms of a given element were identical.

### 2. The alpha scattering experiment, conducted by Rutherford and his team, led to which significant discovery about atomic structure?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Models, Experimental Evidence
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Understanding
- Answer: An atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small, dense nucleus.
- Options:
  - A. A. Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels or shells.
  - B. B. Atoms were solid, indivisible spheres.
  - C. C. An atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small, dense nucleus.
  - D. D. The atom is a sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded.

> The deflection of some alpha particles by the gold foil indicated that the atom's positive charge and most of its mass were concentrated in a tiny central region, which Rutherford named the nucleus.

### 3. Which statement best describes the nuclear model of the atom?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Models
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall
- Answer: It consists of a dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it.
- Options:
  - A. A. A uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered throughout.
  - B. B. A dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it.
  - C. C. Indivisible solid spheres.
  - D. D. Electrons existing in fixed energy levels (shells).

> The nuclear model, proposed by Rutherford, describes the atom as having a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at its center, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around it.

### 4. Which sub-atomic particle, an uncharged particle, was discovered by James Chadwick?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Sub-atomic Particles, History of Atomic Theory
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q7
- Answer: The neutron.
- Options:
  - A. A. The proton.
  - B. B. The electron.
  - C. C. The neutron.
  - D. D. The alpha particle.

> James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to that of a proton, located in the nucleus.

### 5. In which specific region of an atom are protons and neutrons found?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Structure, Sub-atomic Particles
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q8
- Answer: In the nucleus.
- Options:
  - A. A. In the electron shells.
  - B. B. Orbiting the nucleus.
  - C. C. In the nucleus.
  - D. D. Distributed throughout the atom's volume.

> Protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons, are tightly packed together in the central part of the atom called the nucleus.

### 6. What are the approximate relative masses of a proton, neutron, and electron, respectively?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Sub-atomic Particles
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q9
- Answer: Proton: 1, Neutron: 1, Electron: 0 (very small).
- Options:
  - A. A. Proton: 1, Neutron: 1, Electron: 0 (very small).
  - B. B. Proton: 0, Neutron: 1, Electron: 1.
  - C. C. Proton: 1, Neutron: 0, Electron: 1.
  - D. D. Proton: 1, Neutron: 1, Electron: -1.

> Protons and neutrons have a relative mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit each, while electrons have a negligible relative mass, often approximated as 0 for calculations.

### 7. How can you determine the number of protons in an atom of a specific element?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Number, Periodic Table
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q11
- Answer: By referring to the atomic number on the Periodic Table.

> The atomic number (Z) of an element, found on the Periodic Table, directly corresponds to the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element.

### 8. Explain how to calculate the number of neutrons in an atom, given its mass number and atomic number.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure, Mass Number
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Application
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q12
- Answer: Subtract the atomic number from the mass number.

> The mass number (A) represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. By subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number, you get the number of neutrons.

### 9. Why do atoms typically have no overall electrical charge?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Structure, Charge Balance
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understanding
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q13
- Answer: They contain equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.
- Options:
  - A. A. They only contain neutrons, which are neutral.
  - B. B. They contain equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.
  - C. C. The positive charge of the nucleus is cancelled out by the negative charge of the neutrons.
  - D. D. Electrons are uncharged when in fixed energy levels.

> In a neutral atom, the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus, resulting in a net charge of zero.

### 10. According to the Bohr model, what is the maximum number of electrons that can be placed in the first, second, and third electron shells, respectively?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Electron Configuration, Bohr Model
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q14
- Answer: Up to 2 in the first shell and up to 8 in the second and third shells.
- Options:
  - A. A. 2, 8, 8
  - B. B. 2, 2, 8
  - C. C. 8, 8, 2
  - D. D. 2, 8, 18

> The electron shells have specific capacities: the first shell can hold up to 2 electrons, and the second and third shells can hold up to 8 electrons each (for the first 20 elements, which is typically covered at GCSE).
