- Answer: A. Atoms as solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
- Options:
  - A. A. Atoms as solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.
  - B. B. A sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
  - C. C. A dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it.
  - D. D. Atoms with a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons.

> John Dalton's atomic theory, proposed in the early 19th century, described atoms as indivisible, indestructible solid spheres.

### 2. What crucial discovery was made by scientists during the alpha scattering experiment?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Models (Rutherford), Alpha Scattering
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understand, Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q4
- Answer: C. That an atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in one small space (the nucleus).
- Options:
  - A. A. Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels.
  - B. B. Atoms are solid, indivisible spheres.
  - C. C. That an atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in one small space (the nucleus).
  - D. D. The existence of an uncharged particle called the neutron.

> The alpha scattering experiment, led by Rutherford, showed that most alpha particles passed straight through gold foil, but some were deflected at large angles, indicating a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus.

### 3. Describe the key features of the nuclear model of the atom.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Models (Nuclear)
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Describe
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q5
- Answer: A dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it.

> The nuclear model, proposed by Rutherford, posits a central, dense, positively charged nucleus containing most of the atom's mass, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around it.

### 4. Which sub-atomic particle was discovered by James Chadwick?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Sub-atomic Particles, Atomic History
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q7
- Answer: C. The uncharged particle called the neutron.
- Options:
  - A. A. The positively charged proton.
  - B. B. The negatively charged electron.
  - C. C. The uncharged particle called the neutron.
  - D. D. The nucleus, a dense, positively charged center.

> James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to that of a proton, located in the nucleus.

### 5. True or False: Protons and neutrons are located in the electron shells of an atom.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Atomic Structure, Sub-atomic Particles
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Identify, Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q8
- Answer: False.

> Protons and neutrons are found together in the dense central nucleus of an atom, while electrons orbit in shells around the nucleus.

### 6. State the relative electrical charge of a proton, a neutron, and an electron.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Sub-atomic Particles
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q10
- Answer: Proton: +1, Neutron: 0, Electron: -1.

> Protons carry a relative charge of +1, electrons carry a relative charge of -1, and neutrons are electrically neutral with a relative charge of 0.

### 7. How can the number of protons in an atom be determined?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Number, Periodic Table
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Identify, Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q11
- Answer: B. By referring to the atomic number on the Periodic Table.
- Options:
  - A. A. By subtracting the mass number from the atomic number.
  - B. B. By referring to the atomic number on the Periodic Table.
  - C. C. By counting the number of electrons in the outermost shell.
  - D. D. By adding the number of neutrons and electrons.

> The atomic number (or proton number) is unique to each element and represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. It is found on the Periodic Table.

### 8. How is the number of neutrons in an atom calculated?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Atomic Structure, Calculations
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Calculate
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q12
- Answer: Mass number - atomic number.

> The mass number represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. By subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number, the number of neutrons can be found.

### 9. What is the maximum number of electrons that can be placed in the first, second, and third electron shells, respectively?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Electron Shells, Electron Configuration
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q14
- Answer: C. Up to 2 in the first shell and up to 8 in the second and third shells.
- Options:
  - A. A. Up to 8 in the first shell, 2 in the second, and 8 in the third.
  - B. B. Up to 2 in the first shell, 8 in the second, and 18 in the third.
  - C. C. Up to 2 in the first shell and up to 8 in the second and third shells.
  - D. D. Up to 2 in the first shell, 8 in the second, and 8 in the third (for stable atoms).

> For the first 20 elements, the electron shells fill in a specific order: the first shell holds a maximum of 2 electrons, and the second and third shells can hold up to 8 electrons each (for stable atoms, though the third can hold more in general, 8 is the common rule for GCSE).

### 10. What are isotopes?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Isotopes
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Define
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q18
- Answer: B. Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) with different numbers of neutrons.
- Options:
  - A. A. Atoms of different elements with the same mass number.
  - B. B. Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) with different numbers of neutrons.
  - C. C. Ions of the same element with different charges.
  - D. D. Atoms that have gained or lost electrons.

> Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which have the same number of protons (atomic number) but different numbers of neutrons, and therefore different mass numbers.
