## Questions

### 1. Which sub-atomic particle has a relative mass of 1 and a relative charge of 0?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Interpret properties
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q9 & Q10
- Answer: B. Neutron
- Options:
  - A. A. Proton
  - B. B. Neutron
  - C. C. Electron
  - D. D. Nucleus

> Based on the provided data, the neutron is the sub-atomic particle with a relative mass of 1 and a neutral charge of 0.

### 2. What was the major difference introduced by the nuclear model compared to the plum pudding model?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Compare scientific models
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q3, Q4 & Q5
- Answer: C. A small, dense, positive nucleus
- Options:
  - A. A. The existence of electrons
  - B. B. The atom being a solid sphere
  - C. C. A small, dense, positive nucleus
  - D. D. The presence of neutrons

> The alpha scattering experiment showed that an atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small central nucleus, which was the key feature of the nuclear model, contrasting with the plum pudding model's 'sphere of positive charge'.

### 3. True or False: The key difference between a compound and a mixture is that the substances in a compound are chemically joined together.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Elements, Compounds & Mixtures
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Differentiate key terms
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q16 & Q17
- Answer: True

> A compound is defined as a substance made of atoms that are 'chemically joined together', whereas a mixture consists of substances that are 'not chemically combined'.

### 4. According to the definition of isotopes, which quantity is always the same for atoms of the same element?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Apply definition
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q18
- Answer: C. Number of protons
- Options:
  - A. A. Number of neutrons
  - B. B. Mass number
  - C. C. Number of protons
  - D. D. Relative mass

> The definition of isotopes explicitly states they are atoms of the same element with the 'same number of protons' but different numbers of neutrons.

### 5. What is the maximum total number of electrons that can occupy the first and second shells of an atom combined?

- Type: numeric
- Topic: Electron Shells
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Apply rules
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q14
- Answer: 10

> The first electron shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, and the second shell can hold a maximum of 8. The combined maximum capacity is therefore 2 + 8 = 10.

### 6. Which of the following is NOT listed as a physical process for separating mixtures?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Separation Techniques
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall processes
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q19
- Answer: C. Melting
- Options:
  - A. A. Filtration
  - B. B. Crystallisation
  - C. C. Melting
  - D. D. Distillation

> The four listed physical separation processes are filtration, crystallisation, distillation, and chromatography. Melting is a change of state, not a separation technique mentioned in the text.

### 7. An atom is electrically neutral because the number of positive protons is balanced by an equal number of which other particle?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Explain concept
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q13
- Answer: B. Negative electrons
- Options:
  - A. A. Neutral neutrons
  - B. B. Negative electrons
  - C. C. Other positive protons
  - D. D. Negative nuclei

> Atoms have no overall charge because they contain 'equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons', and their opposite charges cancel each other out.

### 8. The alpha scattering experiment provided the crucial evidence that led to the discovery of which feature of the atom?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: History of the Atom
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Link experiment to conclusion
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q4
- Answer: D. A concentrated nucleus
- Options:
  - A. A. Fixed electron shells
  - B. B. The neutron
  - C. C. The indivisible solid sphere
  - D. D. A concentrated nucleus

> The deflection of some alpha particles in the experiment showed that the atom's mass and positive charge must be concentrated in one small space, which was named the nucleus.

### 9. What term describes two or more substances that are present together but are not chemically combined?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Elements, Compounds & Mixtures
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Define key term
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q17
- Answer: A mixture

> This is the definition provided for a mixture in the source material: 'two or more substances not chemically combined'.

### 10. The relative atomic mass is an average. What variation between atoms of the same element does this averaging account for?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Atomic Structure
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Synthesise concepts
- Source reference: C1 questions, Q18 & Q20
- Answer: C. Different numbers of neutrons
- Options:
  - A. A. Different numbers of protons
  - B. B. Different numbers of electrons
  - C. C. Different numbers of neutrons
  - D. D. Different chemical bonds

> Relative atomic mass is the 'average mass of all the atoms of an element'. Since isotopes are atoms of the same element with 'different numbers of neutrons', they have different masses. The average mass accounts for this isotopic variation.
