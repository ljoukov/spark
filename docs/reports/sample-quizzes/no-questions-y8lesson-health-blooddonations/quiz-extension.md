## Questions

### 1. According to the study material, approximately how many new blood donors are needed in England every day?

- Type: numeric
- Topic: Blood Donation
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall numerical data
- Source reference: Page 6
- Answer: 400

> Page 6 states, 'Nearly 400 new blood donors are needed every day in England to meet demand.'

### 2. Under the 2020 'opt-out' organ donation law in England, some individuals are in an 'excluded group'. What example of an excluded group is given in the text?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Organ Donation Law
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Identify specific examples
- Source reference: Page 13
- Answer: A. Visitors to England
- Options:
  - A. A. Visitors to England
  - B. B. People over 65
  - C. C. People with pre-existing medical conditions
  - D. D. Family members of existing donors

> Page 13 specifies that excluded groups include, for example, 'visitors to England'. The other options are not mentioned in the text.

### 3. True or False: The most common method of stem cell donation, used by 90% of donors, is the bone marrow donation procedure.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Stem Cell Donation
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Differentiate between processes based on frequency
- Source reference: Page 10
- Answer: False

> This is false. Page 10 states that 90% of stem cells are donated 'through the bloodstream'. The bone marrow donation procedure is less common, accounting for 10% of donations.

### 4. If a person dies in circumstances where organ donation is possible, what is the first action a specialist nurse would take?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Organ Donation
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Sequence a process
- Source reference: Page 11
- Answer: Check the NHS Organ Donor Register for a registered decision.

> As outlined in step 2 on page 11, the specialist nurses would first 'check the NHS Organ Donor Register to see if that person had registered a decision about organ and tissue donation.'

### 5. What proportion of UK patients in need of a stem cell transplant are unable to find a suitable match from a relative?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Stem Cell Donation
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall statistical information
- Source reference: Page 6
- Answer: C. 75%
- Options:
  - A. A. 10%
  - B. B. 25%
  - C. C. 75%
  - D. D. 90%

> Page 6 states that '75% of UK patients in need of a stem cell transplant are not able to find a match from a relative and need an unrelated donor.'

### 6. Besides registering a decision on the NHS Organ Donation Register, what other important action is recommended for individuals who wish to be organ donors?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Organ Donation
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Synthesise information
- Source reference: Page 11, Page 13
- Answer: Share the decision with family/loved ones.

> Page 11 advises donors to 'Share the decision with family/loved ones.' Page 13 also highlights the importance of discussing the choice with family.

### 7. The material lists several situations that may require a blood donation. Which of the following is NOT mentioned?

- Type: multiple_choice

- Answer: D. A birth defect
- Options:
  - A. A. Blood loss from surgery
  - B. B. Blood loss from child birth
  - C. C. Blood loss from an accident
  - D. D. A birth defect

> Page 5 lists blood loss from surgery, child birth, and accidents as reasons for needing a blood donation. A birth defect is listed as a reason for needing an organ donation, not a blood donation.

### 8. True or False: To become a potential stem cell donor in the UK, an individual must sign up separately with the British Bone Marrow Registry, Anthony Nolan, and DKMS.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Stem Cell Donation
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Understand system structure
- Source reference: Page 9
- Answer: False

> This is false. Page 9 states, 'There are different registers in the UK but they all form part of one UK registry... Donors need only sign up to one.'

### 9. Within the typical one-hour blood donation appointment, what is the approximate time taken for the actual donation itself?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Blood Donation
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Extract specific time-related data
- Source reference: Page 8
- Answer: 5-10 minutes

> Step 3 on page 8 states, 'The donation process takes roughly 1 hour – donating itself just 5-10 minutes.'
