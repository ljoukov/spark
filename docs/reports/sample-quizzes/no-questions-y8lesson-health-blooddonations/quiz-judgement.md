# Sample 1: Y8Lesson-Health-BloodDonations.pdf (synthesis) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is excellent, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and suitable for an exam setting. Answer precision is consistently high, with all answers factually correct and directly verifiable from the provided source material. The quiz also achieves good difficulty alignment, offering a suitable mix of foundation and intermediate-level questions appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. Furthermore, the quiz maintains an appropriate safety and tone, avoiding any misinformation or off-spec content. While the coverage is good for the number of questions, it effectively addresses key concepts related to blood, organ, and stem cell donation, including reasons, processes, and legal aspects, with a balanced mix of question types. The self-identified 'coverage gaps' in the quiz summary are reasonable given the scope of the source material.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and well-phrased, making them exam-ready and clear for students. They directly address information presented in the slides.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - Every answer provided is factually correct and can be directly traced back to specific information on the referenced pages of the source material. Explanations for answers are accurate and helpful.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.90
  - The quiz covers key aspects of blood, organ, and stem cell donation, including importance, processes, and legal considerations, aligning well with the learning intentions. There is a good balance of question types (numeric, multiple-choice, true/false, short answer). While 6 questions provide a solid snapshot, a slightly larger quiz might offer more comprehensive coverage of all learning intentions, but for its length, it is well-balanced.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are appropriately varied in challenge, ranging from direct recall (foundation) to application and interpretation (intermediate), which is suitable for GCSE Triple Science students. The assigned difficulty levels are accurate.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz content is entirely factual, educational, and maintains a neutral, appropriate tone. There is no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content present.
