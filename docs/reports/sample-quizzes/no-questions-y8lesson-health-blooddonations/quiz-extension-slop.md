## Prompt

```
You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.
Work in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.
General guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.
Rubric:
- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.
- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.
- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.
- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.
- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.
- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.
- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.
Scoring scale:
- 0 — no issue observed.
- 1 — slight issue; isolated.
- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.
- 3 — major issue across sections.
- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.
Domain weighting guidance:
- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.
- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.
- Other: average of the two profiles.
When quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).
For each axis include an auto_signals array of {"name":<metric>,"value":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.
After scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.
Return JSON only, matching the schema.

Q10: Why is it important for someone who wants to be an organ donor to register their decision and discuss their choice with their family?
Topic: Individual choice to donate
Difficulty: higher
Skill focus: Analysis of considerations
Answer: It is important to register the decision so that specialist nurses can check the NHS Organ Donor Register if donation is a possibility after death. Discussing with family ensures they are aware of the decision and can respect it, as specialist nurses will still consult families as part of end-of-life discussions, respecting their faith, beliefs, and culture.
Explanation: Page 11 advises to "Register the decision... Share the decision with family/loved ones." Page 13 further emphasizes, "If someone does want to be a donor, why is it important that that they register their decision and discuss their choice with their family?" and notes that "families will still be consulted around organ donation and their faiths, beliefs and culture will continue to be respected."
