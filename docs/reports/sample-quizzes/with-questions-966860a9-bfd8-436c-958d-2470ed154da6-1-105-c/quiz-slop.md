## Prompt

```
You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.
Work in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.
General guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.
Rubric:
- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.
- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.
- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.
- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.
- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.
- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.
- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.
Scoring scale:
- 0 — no issue observed.
- 1 — slight issue; isolated.
- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.
- 3 — major issue across sections.
- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.
Domain weighting guidance:
- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.
- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.
- Other: average of the two profiles.
When quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).
For each axis include an auto_signals array of {"name":<metric>,"value":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.
After scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.
Return JSON only, matching the schema.

Q1: How are covalent bonds formed?
Topic: Covalent Bond Formation
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: By atoms sharing electrons
Options:
- A. By atoms sharing electrons
- B. By atoms transferring electrons
- C. By atoms gaining electrons
- D. By atoms losing electrons
Explanation: Covalent bonds are formed when two non-metal atoms share one or more pairs of electrons to achieve a stable outer electron shell.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q1

Q2: Which type of atoms typically form covalent bonds between them?
Topic: Types of Atoms in Covalent Bonds
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: Non-metals
Options:
- A. Metals and non-metals
- B. Non-metals
- C. Metals
- D. Noble gases
Explanation: Covalent bonds primarily occur between non-metal atoms, as they both have high electronegativity and tend to share electrons rather than transfer them.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q2

Q3: Why do giant covalent substances have high melting points?
Topic: Properties of Giant Covalent Structures
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Explanation
Answer: It takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms.
Explanation: Giant covalent structures consist of billions of atoms held together by a vast network of strong covalent bonds. A significant amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these strong bonds throughout the entire structure, leading to very high melting points.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q6

Q4: Why do small molecules have low melting points?
Topic: Properties of Simple Molecular Structures
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Explanation
Answer: Only a small amount of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces.
Explanation: Small molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds within the molecule, but the forces between individual molecules (intermolecular forces) are weak. Only a small amount of energy is required to overcome these weak intermolecular forces, resulting in low melting and boiling points.

Q5: Why can graphite conduct electricity?
Topic: Graphite Properties
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Explanation
Answer: The delocalised electrons can move through the graphite.
Explanation: In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms, leaving one outer electron per atom free. These electrons become delocalised and are free to move between the layers, allowing graphite to conduct electricity.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q11

Q6: What is graphene?
Topic: Graphene Definition
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Definition
Answer: A single layer of graphite
Options:
- A. A single layer of graphite
- B. A hollow cage of carbon atoms
- C. A hollow cylinder of carbon atoms
- D. A giant covalent lattice of silicon atoms
Explanation: Graphene is an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single, two-dimensional layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, essentially one atomic layer of graphite.
