- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Covalent Bonding
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall definition
- Source reference: C2 Question 1
- Answer: By atoms sharing electrons.

> Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, typically non-metals, to achieve a stable electron configuration.

### 2. Which type of atoms form covalent bonds between them?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Covalent Bonding
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall fact
- Source reference: C2 Question 2
- Answer: Non-metals.

> Covalent bonds typically form between non-metal atoms, which have similar electronegativities and share electrons to complete their outer shells.

### 3. Describe the structure and bonding of a giant covalent substance.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Giant Covalent Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Describe structure and bonding
- Source reference: C2 Question 3
- Answer: Billions of atoms are bonded together by strong covalent bonds throughout the structure.

> In a giant covalent structure, there are no individual molecules. All atoms are linked by a network of strong covalent bonds, forming a macromolecular lattice.

### 4. Describe the structure and bonding of small molecules.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Simple Molecular Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Describe structure and bonding
- Source reference: C2 Question 4
- Answer: Small numbers of atoms group together into molecules with strong covalent bonds within the molecules and weak intermolecular forces between the molecules.

> Simple molecular substances consist of discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces, while the atoms within each molecule are joined by strong covalent bonds.

### 5. Describe the structure and bonding of polymers.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Describe structure and bonding
- Source reference: C2 Question 5
- Answer: Many identical molecules are joined together by strong covalent bonds in a long chain, with weak intermolecular forces between the chains.

> Polymers are large molecules made of repeating monomer units linked by strong covalent bonds. The long chains are attracted to each other by intermolecular forces.

### 6. Why do giant covalent substances have high melting points?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Giant Covalent Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 6
- Answer: A large amount of energy is required to break the numerous strong covalent bonds between the atoms.

> The high melting and boiling points of giant covalent structures are due to the need to overcome the strong covalent bonds throughout the lattice, which requires a lot of thermal energy.

### 7. Why do small molecules have low melting points?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Simple Molecular Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 7
- Answer: Only a small amount of energy is needed to overcome the weak intermolecular forces between molecules.

> When a simple molecular substance melts or boils, it is the weak intermolecular forces that are broken, not the strong covalent bonds within the molecules. This requires relatively little energy.

### 8. Why do large molecules have higher melting and boiling points than small molecules?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Compare and explain properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 8
- Answer: The intermolecular forces are stronger in large molecules.

> Larger molecules have more points of contact, leading to stronger overall intermolecular forces. More energy is needed to overcome these forces compared to the forces between smaller molecules.

### 9. Why do most covalent substances not conduct electricity?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Properties of Covalent Substances
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 9
- Answer: They do not have delocalised electrons or free-moving ions to carry an electrical charge.

> For a substance to conduct electricity, it must contain charged particles that are free to move. In most covalent substances, electrons are held in fixed bonds and there are no ions.

### 10. Describe the structure and bonding in graphite.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Describe structure and bonding
- Source reference: C2 Question 10
- Answer: Each carbon atom is bonded to three others in hexagonal rings arranged in layers. It has delocalised electrons and weak forces between the layers.

> Graphite is an allotrope of carbon with a layered, giant covalent structure. The delocalised electrons are responsible for its conductivity, and the weak forces between layers allow them to slide.

### 11. Why can graphite conduct electricity?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 11
- Answer: The delocalised electrons are free to move through the structure and carry charge.

> Each carbon atom in graphite donates one electron to a delocalised system, creating a 'sea' of electrons that can move along the layers when a voltage is applied.

### 12. Explain why graphite is soft.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 12
- Answer: The layers are not covalently bonded to each other and can slide over one another easily due to weak intermolecular forces.

> The weak forces of attraction between the layers in graphite require little energy to overcome, allowing the layers to slip. This property makes graphite useful as a lubricant.

### 13. What is graphene?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall definition
- Source reference: C2 Question 13
- Answer: A single layer of graphite.

> Graphene is a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.

### 14. Give two properties of graphene.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 14
- Answer: It is very strong and conducts electricity.

> Graphene's strength comes from its network of strong covalent bonds, and its conductivity is due to delocalised electrons across the single layer.

### 15. What is a fullerene?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall definition
- Source reference: C2 Question 15
