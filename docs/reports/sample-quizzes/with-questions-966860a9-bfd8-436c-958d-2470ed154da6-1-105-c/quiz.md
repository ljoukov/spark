## Questions

### 1. How are covalent bonds formed?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Covalent Bond Formation
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q1
- Answer: By atoms sharing electrons
- Options:
  - A. By atoms sharing electrons
  - B. By atoms transferring electrons
  - C. By atoms gaining electrons
  - D. By atoms losing electrons

> Covalent bonds are formed when two non-metal atoms share one or more pairs of electrons to achieve a stable outer electron shell.

### 2. Which type of atoms typically form covalent bonds between them?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Types of Atoms in Covalent Bonds
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q2
- Answer: Non-metals
- Options:
  - A. Metals and non-metals
  - B. Non-metals
  - C. Metals
  - D. Noble gases

> Covalent bonds primarily occur between non-metal atoms, as they both have high electronegativity and tend to share electrons rather than transfer them.

### 3. Why do giant covalent substances have high melting points?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Properties of Giant Covalent Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q6
- Answer: It takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms.

> Giant covalent structures consist of billions of atoms held together by a vast network of strong covalent bonds. A significant amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these strong bonds throughout the entire structure, leading to very high melting points.

### 4. Why do small molecules have low melting points?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Properties of Simple Molecular Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q7
- Answer: Only a small amount of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces.

> Small molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds within the molecule, but the forces between individual molecules (intermolecular forces) are weak. Only a small amount of energy is required to overcome these weak intermolecular forces, resulting in low melting and boiling points.

### 5. Why can graphite conduct electricity?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Graphite Properties
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q11
- Answer: The delocalised electrons can move through the graphite.

> In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms, leaving one outer electron per atom free. These electrons become delocalised and are free to move between the layers, allowing graphite to conduct electricity.

### 6. What is graphene?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Graphene Definition
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Definition
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q13
- Answer: A single layer of graphite
- Options:
  - A. A single layer of graphite
  - B. A hollow cage of carbon atoms
  - C. A hollow cylinder of carbon atoms
  - D. A giant covalent lattice of silicon atoms

> Graphene is an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single, two-dimensional layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, essentially one atomic layer of graphite.
