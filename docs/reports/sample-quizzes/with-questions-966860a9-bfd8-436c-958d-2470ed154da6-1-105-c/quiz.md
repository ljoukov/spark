## Questions

### 1. How are covalent bonds formed?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Covalent Bonding Basics
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q1
- Answer: by atoms sharing electrons
- Options:
  - A. by atoms transferring electrons
  - B. by atoms sharing electrons
  - C. by atoms gaining electrons
  - D. by atoms losing electrons

> Covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration.

### 2. Describe the structure and bonding of a giant covalent substance.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Giant Covalent Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Description
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q3
- Answer: billions of atoms bonded together by strong covalent bonds

> Giant covalent structures consist of a vast, repeating network of billions of atoms held together by strong covalent bonds throughout the entire structure.

### 3. Why do giant covalent substances have high melting points?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Properties of Giant Covalent Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q6
- Answer: it takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms

> Due to the extensive network of strong covalent bonds throughout the entire structure, a significant amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these bonds, resulting in high melting points.

### 4. Describe the structure and bonding in graphite.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Graphite Structure
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Description
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q10
- Answer: each carbon atom is bonded to three others in hexagonal rings arranged in layers – it has delocalised electrons and weak forces between the layers

> Graphite is a giant covalent structure where each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms, forming hexagonal rings arranged in layers. These layers are held together by weak intermolecular forces, and there are delocalised electrons within the layers.

### 5. Why can graphite conduct electricity?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Properties of Graphite
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation, Recall
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q11
- Answer: the delocalised electrons can move through the graphite
- Options:
  - A. It has free ions that can carry charge.
  - B. The strong covalent bonds allow electrons to flow easily.
  - C. It has delocalised electrons that can move through the structure.
  - D. Its layered structure allows for electron transfer between layers.

> In graphite, each carbon atom forms only three covalent bonds, leaving one outer electron per atom delocalised. These delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the layers, allowing graphite to conduct electricity.

### 6. What is a fullerene?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Fullerenes
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Definition, Recall
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q15
- Answer: hollow cage of carbon atoms arranged as a sphere or a tube
- Options:
  - A. A single layer of graphite.
  - B. A giant covalent lattice of silicon atoms.
  - C. A hollow cage of carbon atoms arranged as a sphere or a tube.
  - D. A long chain of identical monomer units.

> Fullerenes are a class of carbon allotropes consisting of hollow molecular cages, typically spherical (like buckyballs) or cylindrical (nanotubes).
