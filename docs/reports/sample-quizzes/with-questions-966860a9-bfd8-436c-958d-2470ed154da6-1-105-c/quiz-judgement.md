# Sample 3: 966860A9-BFD8-436C-958D-2470ED154DA6_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates strong performance in 'Question quality', 'Answer precision', 'Difficulty alignment', and 'Safety & tone'. The prompts are precise and exam-ready, and the answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the source material. The difficulty levels are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, and the content is safe and on-spec. However, the 'Coverage and balance' of the quiz is significantly limited, as it only utilises 6 out of the 18 available questions from the provided source material, leaving many key concepts within the C2 Covalent bonding topic unaddressed.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - Prompts are precise, unambiguous, and directly extracted from the source material, making them exam-ready for GCSE.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - Answers are factually correct and are direct matches to the answers provided in the source material.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.50
  - While the quiz includes a suitable mix of question types and covers some fundamental concepts of covalent bonding (formation, giant covalent structures, graphite, fullerenes), it only utilises 6 out of 18 available questions from the provided source material. This leaves many other key concepts from the C2 Covalent bonding topic (e.g., small molecules, polymers, properties of different covalent structures, graphene, nanotubes, uses of fullerenes) uncovered, limiting the overall breadth of the quiz.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with a good variation in challenge levels (foundation, intermediate, higher) and skill focus (recall, description, explanation).
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The content is accurate, relevant to the GCSE specification, and free from misinformation or inappropriate tone.

## Model metadata

- Model: gemini-2.5-flash (temperature 0.15)

## Audit

- Model: gemini-2.5-pro (temperature 0.15)
- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is accurate and well-supported. The candidate quiz is well-constructed in terms of question quality and answer precision, drawing directly from the source. However, the judge correctly identifies the major flaw: a significant lack of coverage. The source material contains 18 question-and-answer pairs, but the quiz only utilizes 6 of them (one-third). This omits key topics like small molecules, polymers, graphene, and nanotubes, which are present in the source. Therefore, the low score for 'Coverage and balance' and the resulting 'revise' verdict are entirely justified.

## Prompt

```
You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.
Rubric:
- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?
- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?
- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?
- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?
- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.
Use the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.
Return JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.
verdict must be "approve" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise "revise" with actionable reasoning.
Provide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.
