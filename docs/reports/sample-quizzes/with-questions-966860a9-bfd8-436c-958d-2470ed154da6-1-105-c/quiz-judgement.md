# Sample 3: 966860A9-BFD8-436C-958D-2470ED154DA6_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Base Quiz Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The quiz demonstrates excellent "Question quality" and "Answer precision", with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, and answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material. "Difficulty alignment" is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable mix of foundation and intermediate questions. The "Safety & tone" are also exemplary. However, the "Coverage and balance" is significantly limited, as only a third of the available questions from the source material have been included, leading to omissions of several key concepts.

## Rubric findings

- **Question quality** — score 1.00
  - All prompts are precise, unambiguous, and directly extracted from the source material, making them exam-ready and suitable for GCSE level.
- **Answer precision** — score 1.00
  - All answers are factually correct, directly grounded in the provided answers column, and the explanations are accurate and helpful.
- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.50
  - While the selected questions cover some fundamental aspects and offer a good mix of question types (MCQ/SA), the quiz only includes 6 out of 18 questions from the source material. This significantly limits the overall coverage, omitting key concepts such as detailed structural descriptions, polymers, and other carbon allotropes (fullerenes, nanotubes) that are present in the original retrieval practice.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The questions are well-aligned with GCSE Triple Science, featuring a suitable range of difficulty from foundation recall to intermediate explanation tasks.
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00
  - The quiz is free from misinformation, harmful content, or off-spec material, maintaining an appropriate educational tone.

## Audit

- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is entirely reasonable. The judge correctly identifies that the quality of the individual questions and answers is high, but the quiz's main failing is its poor coverage. The candidate quiz only uses 6 out of the 18 available questions from the source material. The judge accurately points out that this omits several key topics, such as polymers, fullerenes, and nanotubes. This significant lack of coverage fully justifies the low score for the 'Coverage and balance' criterion and the overall 'revise' verdict.
