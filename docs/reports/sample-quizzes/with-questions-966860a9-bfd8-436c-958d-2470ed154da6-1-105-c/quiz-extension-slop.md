## Prompt

```
You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.
Work in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.
General guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.
Rubric:
- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.
- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.
- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.
- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.
- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.
- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.
- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.
Scoring scale:
- 0 — no issue observed.
- 1 — slight issue; isolated.
- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.
- 3 — major issue across sections.
- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.
Domain weighting guidance:
- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.
- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.
- Other: average of the two profiles.
When quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).
For each axis include an auto_signals array of {"name":<metric>,"value":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.
After scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.
Return JSON only, matching the schema.

Q1: Describe the general structure and bonding characteristics of a giant covalent substance.
Topic: Giant Covalent Structure
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Description
Answer: Billions of atoms bonded together by strong covalent bonds.
Explanation: Giant covalent substances form extensive networks where billions of atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds throughout the entire structure, creating a vast lattice.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q3

Q2: Which statement accurately describes the structure and bonding within and between small molecules?
Topic: Small Molecular Structure
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Description/Analysis
Answer: Small numbers of atoms group together into molecules with strong covalent bonds between the atoms and weak intermolecular forces between the molecules.
Options:
- A. Small numbers of atoms group together into molecules with strong covalent bonds between the atoms and weak intermolecular forces between the molecules.
- B. Billions of atoms bonded together by strong covalent bonds throughout the entire structure.
- C. Many identical molecules joined together by strong covalent bonds in a long chain, with weak intermolecular forces between the chains.
- D. Atoms are held together by strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions.
Explanation: Small molecules are discrete units where a few atoms are strongly covalently bonded together. However, the forces *between* these individual molecules are weak intermolecular forces, which are easily overcome.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q4

Q3: Describe the structure and bonding of polymers.
Topic: Polymer Structure
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Description
Answer: Many identical molecules joined together by strong covalent bonds in a long chain, with weak intermolecular forces between the chains.
Explanation: Polymers are large molecules composed of many identical repeating units (monomers) linked by strong covalent bonds to form long chains. Weak intermolecular forces exist between these polymer chains.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q5

Q4: Compared to small molecules, why do large molecules typically exhibit higher melting and boiling points?
Topic: Properties of Large Molecules
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Explanation/Reasoning
Answer: The intermolecular forces are stronger in large molecules.
Options:
- A. The covalent bonds within large molecules are stronger.
- B. Large molecules have more delocalised electrons.
- C. The intermolecular forces are stronger in large molecules.
- D. Large molecules have a more complex crystal lattice structure.
Explanation: As the size of molecules increases, the cumulative strength of the intermolecular forces between them also increases. More energy is required to overcome these stronger forces, leading to higher melting and boiling points.

Q5: Explain why the majority of covalent substances are unable to conduct electricity.
Topic: Covalent Substances and Conductivity
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Explanation
Answer: They do not have delocalised electrons or ions.
Explanation: Electrical conductivity requires the presence of mobile charged particles, such as delocalised electrons or free ions. Most covalent substances have all their outer electrons localised in bonds and do not form ions, hence they cannot conduct electricity.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q9

Q6: Detail the structure and bonding characteristics of graphite.
Topic: Graphite Structure and Bonding
Difficulty: higher
Skill focus: Description/Analysis
Answer: Each carbon atom is bonded to three others in hexagonal rings arranged in layers – it has delocalised electrons and weak forces between the layers.
Explanation: Graphite consists of layers of carbon atoms, where each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms in hexagonal rings. This leaves one outer electron per carbon atom delocalised, and weak intermolecular forces exist between the layers.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q10

Q7: What property of graphite's structure accounts for its softness and ability to act as a lubricant?
Topic: Graphite Properties
Difficulty: intermediate
Skill focus: Explanation
Answer: Layers are not bonded so can slide over each other.
Options:
- A. It has delocalised electrons that allow for easy movement.
- B. The carbon atoms are only weakly bonded together.
- C. Layers are not bonded so can slide over each other.
- D. It forms a hollow cage structure.
Explanation: The weak intermolecular forces between the distinct layers of carbon atoms in graphite allow these layers to easily slide past one another, which makes graphite soft and slippery, useful as a lubricant.
Source reference: C2 questions, Q12

Q8: List two distinct properties of graphene.
Topic: Graphene Properties
Difficulty: foundation
Skill focus: Recall
Answer: Strong, conducts electricity.
Explanation: Graphene is known for its exceptional strength due to its robust covalent bonding network and its ability to conduct electricity efficiently because of its delocalised electrons.
