## Questions

### 1. Which statement correctly contrasts the forces overcome when melting a simple molecular substance and a giant covalent substance?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Structure and Properties
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Compare and contrast
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. Strong covalent bonds are broken in both types of substances.
  - B. B. Weak intermolecular forces are broken in simple molecules, while strong covalent bonds are broken in giant structures.
  - C. C. Weak intermolecular forces are broken in both types of substances.
  - D. D. Strong covalent bonds are broken in simple molecules, while weak intermolecular forces are broken in giant structures.

> When melting a simple molecular substance, weak intermolecular forces are overcome. For a giant covalent substance, a large number of strong covalent bonds must be broken, which requires significantly more energy.

### 2. What specific shape of fullerene is mentioned as being suitable for drug delivery?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall specific application
- Answer: Spheres (or spherical).

> The source material specifies that spherical fullerenes are used for drug delivery, as their hollow cage structure can encapsulate molecules.

### 3. A carbon nanotube can be described as a hollow cylinder formed from a rolled-up sheet of graphene. True or False?

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Relate structures
- Answer: True

> A nanotube is defined as a hollow cylinder of carbon atoms, which is structurally equivalent to a single layer of graphite (graphene) rolled into a tube.

### 4. Graphite is soft and can be used as a lubricant. Which feature of its structure is responsible for this property?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Link structure to property
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A. The strong covalent bonds within the hexagonal rings.
  - B. B. The presence of delocalised electrons.
  - C. C. The weak forces between the layers of atoms.
  - D. D. Each carbon atom being bonded to three others.

> Graphite consists of layers of carbon atoms that are not bonded together, allowing them to slide over each other easily. This makes the substance soft and slippery.

### 5. In a polymer, what type of forces exist between the long molecular chains?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall bonding detail
- Answer: Weak intermolecular forces.

> While the atoms within a polymer chain are joined by strong covalent bonds, the separate chains are held together by weaker intermolecular forces.

### 6. Which allotrope of carbon consists of just a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal rings?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall definition
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A. Graphene
  - B. B. Fullerene
  - C. C. Nanotube
  - D. D. Polymer

> Graphene is defined as a single layer of graphite. Fullerenes are hollow cages, and nanotubes are cylinders.

### 7. Explain why the boiling point of a substance increases as its molecules get larger.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Simple Molecules
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explain trend
- Answer: Because the intermolecular forces become stronger as the molecules get larger.

> Larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces between them, which require more energy to overcome, resulting in higher melting and boiling points.

### 8. What is the fundamental process that occurs when non-metal atoms form a covalent bond?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Covalent Bonding
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall definition
- Answer: D
- Options:
  - A. A. Transferring electrons
  - B. B. Losing electrons
  - C. C. Gaining electrons
  - D. D. Sharing electrons

> Covalent bonds are formed specifically by the sharing of electrons between non-metal atoms to achieve stable electron configurations.

### 9. Giant covalent substances have high melting points because a lot of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces between the atoms. True or False?

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Giant Covalent Structures
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Identify misconception
- Answer: False

> This statement is false. Giant covalent substances have high melting points because a lot of energy is needed to break the many strong covalent bonds between the atoms, not weak intermolecular forces.

### 10. Which pair of properties is common to both graphene and carbon nanotubes?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Synthesise information
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A. High melting point and softness
  - B. B. Softness and electrical conductivity
  - C. C. High tensile strength and electrical conductivity
  - D. D. Use in drug delivery and as a lubricant

> Both graphene and nanotubes are known for their high tensile strength and their ability to conduct electricity due to the presence of delocalised electrons.
