## Questions

### 1. Which statement correctly explains why simple molecular substances have low boiling points?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Simple Molecular Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Application of knowledge
- Source reference: C2 Question 7
- Answer: B
- Options:
  - A. A. The strong covalent bonds within the molecules are easily broken.
  - B. B. Only weak intermolecular forces between molecules need to be overcome.
  - C. C. The substances are formed from non-metal atoms which have low mass.
  - D. D. They do not contain any delocalised electrons.

> To boil a simple molecular substance, energy is needed to overcome the weak intermolecular forces between the molecules, not the strong covalent bonds within them. This requires only a small amount of energy.

### 2. True or false: The forces attracting adjacent polymer chains to each other are strong covalent bonds.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Distinguishing bond types
- Source reference: C2 Question 5
- Answer: False

> The atoms within a polymer chain are joined by strong covalent bonds, but the forces between separate polymer chains are weak intermolecular forces.

### 3. In the structure of graphite, how many other carbon atoms is each carbon atom covalently bonded to?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Recall of specific structural detail
- Source reference: C2 Question 10
- Answer: C
- Options:
  - A. A. One
  - B. B. Two
  - C. C. Three
  - D. D. Four

> Each carbon atom in graphite forms strong covalent bonds with three other carbon atoms, creating hexagonal rings. The fourth outer electron is delocalised.

### 4. What specific structural feature of spherical fullerenes makes them suitable for drug delivery?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Linking structure to application
- Source reference: C2 Question 18
- Answer: Their hollow cage-like structure allows them to enclose and transport other molecules.

> The source material mentions 'drug delivery (spheres)'. This application relies on the fullerene's ability to trap drug molecules inside its hollow carbon cage for transport within the body.

### 5. Which form of carbon is described as a hollow cylinder?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall definition
- Source reference: C2 Question 16
- Answer: D
- Options:
  - A. A. Graphene
  - B. B. Graphite
  - C. C. A spherical fullerene
  - D. D. A nanotube

> A nanotube is a type of fullerene with a cylindrical structure, essentially a rolled-up sheet of graphene.

### 6. Contrast the type of forces that are overcome when a giant covalent substance melts compared to when a polymer melts.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Structure and Bonding
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Comparison and explanation
- Source reference: C2 Questions 5 & 6
- Answer: In a giant covalent substance, strong covalent bonds must be broken. In a polymer, the weaker intermolecular forces between the chains are overcome.

> Melting a giant covalent structure requires breaking the strong covalent bonds throughout the lattice. Melting a polymer only requires overcoming the intermolecular forces between the long chains, not the covalent bonds within them.

### 7. True or false: Graphene is an electrical insulator because it is only one atom thick.

- Type: true_false
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall properties
- Source reference: C2 Question 14
- Answer: False

> Graphene is an excellent conductor of electricity. Its single-layer structure contains delocalised electrons that are free to move and carry charge.

### 8. Which of these substances has delocalised electrons and weak forces between its layers?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Allotropes of Carbon
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Identify substance from structural description
- Source reference: C2 Question 10
- Answer: A
- Options:
  - A. A. Graphite
  - B. B. A polymer
  - C. C. A small molecule like water
  - D. D. A generic giant covalent substance

> Graphite has a layered structure where each carbon is bonded to three others. This leaves delocalised electrons that can move, and the layers are held by weak forces, allowing them to slide.

### 9. Explain why large molecules have stronger intermolecular forces than small molecules.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Polymers
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Explain property trends
- Source reference: C2 Question 8
- Answer: Large molecules have more surface area and more points of contact between them, leading to stronger overall intermolecular forces compared to smaller molecules.

> The strength of intermolecular forces increases with the size of the molecule. This is why polymers have much higher melting and boiling points than simple molecules.

### 10. What is the fundamental process that occurs when atoms form a covalent bond?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Covalent Bonding
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall definition
- Source reference: C2 Question 1
- Answer: Atoms share one or more pairs of electrons.

> Covalent bonding involves the mutual sharing of valence electrons between atoms, typically non-metals, to achieve a stable electron configuration for each atom.
