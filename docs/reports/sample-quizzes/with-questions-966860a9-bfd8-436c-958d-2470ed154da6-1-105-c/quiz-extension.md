## Questions

### 1. Which type of atoms typically form covalent bonds with each other?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Covalent Bond Formation
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Recall
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q2
- Answer: non-metals
- Options:
  - A. A. Metals and non-metals
  - B. B. Metals only
  - C. C. Non-metals only
  - D. D. Metalloids

> Covalent bonds are predominantly formed between non-metal atoms, as they both tend to gain electrons to achieve a full outer shell, making sharing electrons a stable arrangement.

### 2. Describe the structure and bonding of small molecules.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Small Molecular Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Description
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q4
- Answer: small numbers of atoms group together into molecules with strong covalent bonds between the atoms and weak intermolecular forces between the molecules

> Small molecules consist of a limited number of atoms joined by strong covalent bonds. However, the forces between these individual molecules (intermolecular forces) are weak.

### 3. Describe the structure and bonding of polymers.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Polymer Structures
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Description
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q5
- Answer: many identical molecules joined together by strong covalent bonds in a long chain, with weak intermolecular forces between the chains

> Polymers are large molecules formed from many repeating smaller units (monomers) linked by strong covalent bonds into long chains. Weak intermolecular forces exist between these polymer chains.

### 4. Why do substances made of small molecules generally have low melting points?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Properties of Small Molecules
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q7
- Answer: only a small amount of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces
- Options:
  - A. A. They have strong covalent bonds that are easily broken.
  - B. B. Only a small amount of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces between molecules.
  - C. C. They have delocalised electrons that lower the melting point.
  - D. D. The atoms are not bonded together.

> Small molecular substances have low melting points because only a small amount of energy is required to overcome the weak intermolecular forces between the molecules, not to break the strong covalent bonds within them.

### 5. Why do large molecules have higher melting and boiling points than small molecules?

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Molecular Size and Properties
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q8
- Answer: the intermolecular forces are stronger in large molecules

> As molecules increase in size, the cumulative strength of the weak intermolecular forces between them becomes greater. More energy is therefore needed to overcome these stronger forces, leading to higher melting and boiling points.

### 6. Why do most covalent substances not conduct electricity?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Covalent Substances and Conductivity
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q9
- Answer: do not have delocalised electrons or ions
- Options:
  - A. A. They have strong covalent bonds that prevent electron movement.
  - B. B. They are typically solids at room temperature.
  - C. C. They do not have delocalised electrons or ions to carry charge.
  - D. D. Their atoms are too small to allow charge flow.

> For a substance to conduct electricity, it must possess mobile charge carriers, such as delocalised electrons or free ions. Most covalent substances lack these, as their electrons are held tightly in bonds or within specific atoms.

### 7. Explain why graphite is soft.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Properties of Graphite
- Difficulty: intermediate
- Skill focus: Explanation
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q12
- Answer: layers are not bonded so can slide over each other

> Graphite is soft because its structure consists of distinct layers of carbon atoms. The forces between these layers are very weak, allowing them to slide easily over one another, which also makes graphite a good lubricant.

### 8. What is graphene?

- Type: multiple_choice
- Topic: Graphene
- Difficulty: foundation
- Skill focus: Definition
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q13
- Answer: one layer of graphite
- Options:
  - A. A. A type of fullerene.
  - B. B. A giant covalent structure of silicon.
  - C. C. One layer of graphite.
  - D. D. A polymer made of carbon atoms.

> Graphene is a remarkable material consisting of a single, two-dimensional layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, essentially one layer of graphite.

### 9. Give two properties of graphene.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Properties of Graphene
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Recall, Application
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q14
- Answer: strong, conducts electricity

> Graphene is renowned for its exceptional strength, being one of the strongest known materials, and its excellent electrical conductivity due to the presence of delocalised electrons.

### 10. Give two properties of nanotubes.

- Type: short_answer
- Topic: Nanotubes
- Difficulty: higher
- Skill focus: Recall, Application
- Source reference: C2 questions, Q17
- Answer: high tensile strength, conduct electricity

> Nanotubes are known for their high tensile strength, meaning they are incredibly strong and resistant to stretching or breaking, and their ability to conduct electricity efficiently.
