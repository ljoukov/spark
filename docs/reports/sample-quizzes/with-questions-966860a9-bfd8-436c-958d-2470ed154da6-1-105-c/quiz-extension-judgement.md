# Sample 3: 966860A9-BFD8-436C-958D-2470ED154DA6_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Extension Judge

**Verdict:** revise

## Summary

The quiz demonstrates strong adherence to 'Question quality' and 'Answer precision', with prompts being clear, unambiguous, and directly aligned with the provided source material. 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge. 'Safety & tone' are excellent, with no misinformation or off-spec content. However, there are significant issues with 'Coverage and balance'. The quiz summary states it includes 16 questions, but only 10 are provided. Furthermore, several key concepts from the source material, such as the fundamental formation of covalent bonds (Q1 from source), the detailed structure of giant covalent substances (Q3, Q6 from source), and the definition of fullerenes (Q15 from source), are omitted, despite fullerenes being mentioned in the quiz summary as a covered topic. This indicates a lack of comprehensive coverage and internal inconsistency.

- **Coverage and balance** — score 0.50
  - The quiz summary states '16 questions' but only 10 are present. Key concepts from the source material, such as the fundamental formation of covalent bonds, the structure of giant covalent substances, and the definition of fullerenes, are missing. The summary mentions fullerenes, but no definition question for them is included, indicating a lack of comprehensive coverage and internal inconsistency.
- **Difficulty alignment** — score 1.00
  - The items are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and show a good variation in challenge levels (foundation, intermediate, higher).
- **Safety & tone** — score 1.00

- Verdict agreement: agree
- Confidence: high

The judge's verdict is entirely correct and well-supported. The primary issue is with 'Coverage and balance'. The judge accurately identifies the internal inconsistency where the quiz summary claims there are 16 questions, but the quiz itself only contains 10. Furthermore, the judge correctly points out that several key topics from the source material, which are also mentioned in the quiz's own summary (e.g., fullerenes, fundamental formation of covalent bonds), are missing from the actual questions. This lack of comprehensive coverage and the factual error in the summary fully justify the 'revise' verdict and the 0.5 score for that criterion. The judge's positive assessments of the other criteria are also accurate, as the questions that are present are of high quality and directly reflect the source.
