# Sample 3: 966860A9-BFD8-436C-958D-2470ED154DA6_1_105_c.jpeg (extraction) — Extension Quality Judge

**Verdict:** approve

## Summary

The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and directly derived from the provided GCSE retrieval practice material, making them exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is faultless; all answers are factually correct, directly grounded in the source text, and supported by clear, accurate explanations. The 'Coverage and balance' are appropriate for an 'extension' quiz on Covalent Bonding, covering key concepts like giant covalent structures, small molecules, polymers, and various carbon allotropes with a suitable mix of short answer and multiple-choice questions. 'Difficulty alignment' is well-judged, with questions ranging from foundation to higher, appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are fully met, with no misinformation or off-spec content, and consistent use of UK English spelling.
