### Questions

1. **According to the provided information, what is the minimum age to register online to become a blood donor in England?**
   - Type: `multiple_choice`
   - Topic: Blood Donation Process
   - Difficulty: foundation
   - Skill focus: Recall
   - Source reference: Page 8, "What's involved in being a blood donor", step 1
   - Options:
     - A. A. 16
     - B. B. 17
     - C. C. 18
     - D. D. 21
   - Answer:
     A
   - Explanation:
     Slide 8 states: "Register online from 16+ at blood.co.uk."

2. **Explain two reasons why blood and stem cell donations are important for individuals and society, according to the provided material.**
   - Type: `short_answer`
   - Topic: Importance of Donation
   - Difficulty: intermediate
   - Skill focus: Explanation, Synthesis
   - Source reference: Page 6, "Why are donations important?"
   - Answer:
     Blood donations are important because nearly 400 new blood donors are needed every day in England to meet demand. Stem cell donations are important because 75% of UK patients in need of a stem cell transplant cannot find a match from a relative and require an unrelated donor.
   - Explanation:
     The material highlights the daily demand for blood donors and the high percentage of stem cell patients needing unrelated matches, demonstrating the critical need for these donations to save and improve lives.

3. **True or False: In England, from 2020, anyone over 18 is automatically considered an organ donor upon death, regardless of whether they have registered a decision.**
   - Type: `true_false`
   - Topic: Organ Donation Law
   - Difficulty: intermediate
   - Skill focus: Interpretation, Recall
   - Source reference: Page 13, "Organ donation: legal changes to save more lives"
   - Answer:
     False
   - Explanation:
     From 2020, anyone over 18 in England is considered an organ donor unless they have registered a decision *not* to donate or are in an excluded group. Therefore, it is not regardless of whether they have registered a decision, but rather *unless* they have registered a decision not to donate.

4. **What percentage of stem cell donations are typically carried out through the bloodstream, as stated in the provided information?**
   - Type: `numeric`
   - Topic: Stem Cell Donation Process
   - Difficulty: foundation

   - Source reference: Page 10, "What's involved in being a stem cell donor?", step 4
   - Answer:
     90
   - Explanation:
     The material specifies that stem cells can be donated in one of two ways, with "through the bloodstream (90% of donors)" being the more common method.

5. **Which of the following individuals would most likely require an organ donation, according to the provided material?**
   - Type: `multiple_choice`
   - Topic: Organ Donation Recipients
   - Difficulty: intermediate
   - Skill focus: Application, Discrimination

     - B. B. Someone with blood cancer or a blood disorder.
     - C. C. Someone whose organs have been damaged by disease or injury.
     - D. D. Someone needing a routine blood transfusion.
   - Answer:
     C
   - Explanation:
     Page 5 explicitly states that "Someone whose organs have been damaged by disease or injury" and "Someone who has a birth defect" are individuals who might need organ donation. Options A, B, and D relate to blood or stem cell donations.

6. **Identify two distinct reasons an individual might choose not to donate blood or organs, based on the information provided.**
   - Type: `short_answer`
   - Topic: Considerations for Donation
   - Difficulty: higher
   - Skill focus: Analysis, Extraction
   - Source reference: Page 16, "Why do people choose not to donate?"
   - Answer:
     An individual might choose not to donate blood due to a fear of needles. They might also choose not to donate organs because they feel uncomfortable with the idea of their organs being used after death, leading them to opt out on the NHS Organ Donation Register.
   - Explanation:
     The material on page 16 presents two speech bubbles illustrating these specific reasons for choosing not to donate.

   - Source reference: Page 6, "Why are donations important?"
   - Answer:
     Donors from Black African, Black Caribbean and Asian backgrounds, as well as young blood, stem cell and organ donors, are more in demand. This is highlighted because 75% of UK patients in need of a stem cell transplant are not able to find a match from a relative and need an unrelated donor, implying a need for a diverse donor pool to increase matching chances.
