          "It’s September 2, 1954, in Laramie, Wyoming. Richard Bellman, a mathematician from the RAND Corporation, is at the American Mathematical Society’s summer meeting. He’s there to introduce a new method for making a series of decisions. He calls it ‘dynamic programming’ and unveils a core idea now known as the ‘principle of optimality’.",

Bellman needed to keep the funding flowing for his work at RAND, a military think tank. So, he chose his words carefully: ‘dynamic’ sounded powerful, and ‘programming’ was just a synonym for planning. It was a clever disguise for some very serious math.",

Imagine deciding how many spare engines to stock for bomber fleets across the country to keep them ready, without wasting millions on parts that just sit in a warehouse. This was a real issue RAND was working on in the 1950s.",

And the decision you make this month affects what you’ll need next month, and the month after that. A greedy approach—just ordering the cheapest parts now—could lead to disaster later. Bellman’s breakthrough was to solve the problem backward. Start from the end goal—total fleet readiness at the lowest cost—and work your way back, making the optimal decision at each step. By solving these smaller, overlapping problems just once and remembering the answers, you build the perfect plan.",
