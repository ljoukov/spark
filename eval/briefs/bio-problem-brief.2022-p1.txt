Topic: BIO 2022 R1 Q1 — Decrypt

Spark Code Lesson Brief (BIO locked problem)

You are generating a Spark Code lesson. This brief is authoritative.

Exactness rules (what “exactly” means)
- When this brief says “exactly/verbatim”, preserve the original wording and numbers from this brief.
- For inputs/outputs and tests: preserve the exact tokens and the exact spacing between them.
- Output formatting for this problem: output the decrypted string on ONE line (no extra text).
- Do not add, remove, or reorder marking-scheme tests.

Session structure
- The session must follow this exact order: story, quiz1 (question_count=10), problem1, quiz2 (question_count=10), problem2, quiz3 (question_count=10), problem3, quiz4 (wrap-up, question_count=7).
- problem3 is the official BIO problem below, with the same task and constraints.
- problem1 and problem2 should teach the core techniques needed for problem3 (alphabet value mapping, modular wrap, left-to-right processing), but MUST NOT reuse the same statement or the marking tests.
- The session must use progressive disclosure: problem1 is simpler than problem2; quiz1 introduces what is needed to solve problem1; quiz2 introduces what is new for problem2; quiz3 introduces what is needed for problem3; the lesson is focused on enabling the student to solve problem3.

Locked requirements for problem3 (official)
- The problem3 statement and constraints must be taken from the OFFICIAL PROBLEM section below (verbatim).
- Examples shown to the learner for problem3 must use only examples already present in this brief:
  - Prefer examples and sample runs from the OFFICIAL PROBLEM section.
  - If the schema requires exactly three examples and the OFFICIAL PROBLEM has fewer than three, fill the remaining example(s) using cases from the MARKING section (still from this brief). Do not invent new examples.
- The problem3 test list must be EXACTLY the MARKING tests below (same cases, same expected outputs, same order). Do not add any other tests.
- The problem3 reference solution must implement the decryption logic exactly (reverse of the encryption scheme described).
- The problem3 reference solution must be deterministic and must match the expected output formatting exactly.

--- OFFICIAL PROBLEM (verbatim) ---
Question 1: Decrypt
Each letter in the alphabet can be given a value based on its position in the alphabet, A being 1 through
to Z being 26. Two letters can produce a third letter by adding together their values, deducting 26 from
the sum if it is greater than 26, and finding the letter whose value equals this result.
A simple encryption scheme for a string is as follows. Working from left to right, after leaving the left-most character alone, each character is replaced with the character produced by adding it to the
character to its immediate left.
For example:
• The string ENCRYPT goes through the steps ENCRYPT → ESCRYPT → ESVRYPT → ESVNYPT →
  ESVNMPT -> ESVNMCT -> ESVNMCW
1(a) [ 24 marks ]
Write a program that reads in an encrypted string, between 1 and 10 uppercase
letters inclusive, and outputs the original version of that string.
