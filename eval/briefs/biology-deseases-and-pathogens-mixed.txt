#### 4.3.1. Communicable Diseases

##### 4.3.1.1. Communicable (Infectious) Diseases

* **a** I know that pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease.
* **b** I know that pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, protists or fungi that can infect plants or animals.
* **c** I know that bacteria can produce poisons (toxins) that damage tissues and make us feel ill.
* **d** I know that viruses live and reproduce inside body cells, which causes damage to the cell.
* **e** I can explain how pathogens can be spread by direct contact, by water or by air.
* **f** I can explain how the spread of disease can be reduced or prevented.

##### 4.3.1.2. Viral Diseases

* **a** I know that measles is a viral disease showing symptoms of fever and a red skin rash and that it is a serious illness that can be fatal if complications arise (which is why most young children are vaccinated against measles).
* **b** I can describe how the measles virus is spread by air (by inhalation of droplets from sneezes and coughs).
* **c** I know that HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection initially causes a flu-like illness and that the virus attacks the body’s immune cells (white blood cells) if it is not successfully controlled with antiretroviral drugs.
* **d** I know that AIDS occurs when the body's immune system becomes so badly damaged it can no longer deal with other infections or cancers.
* **e** I can explain how HIV is spread (by sexual contact or exchange of body fluids such as blood which occurs when drug users share needles).
* **f** I know that TMV (Tobacco Mosaic Virus) is a widespread plant pathogen affecting many species of plants including tomatoes and that it gives a distinctive ‘mosaic’ pattern of discolouration on the leaves which affects the growth of the plant due to lack of photosynthesis.

##### 4.3.1.3. Bacterial Diseases

* **a** I know that Salmonella food poisoning is caused by bacteria that are spread by ingesting (eating) contaminated food.
* **b** I can describe the symptoms of Salmonella food poisoning as; fever, abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea which are caused by the bacteria and the toxins they secrete.
* **c** I know that, in the UK, poultry are vaccinated against Salmonella to control the spread.
* **d** I know that gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is caused by bacteria.
* **e** I can describe the symptoms of gonorrhoea as; a thick yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis and pain on urinating.
* **f** I know that gonorrhoea was easily treated with penicillin (an antibiotic), until many resistant strains of the bacteria appeared.

##### 4.3.1.4. Fungal Diseases

* **a** I know that rose black spot is a fungal disease where purple or black spots develop on leaves, which often turn yellow and drop early.
* **b** I know that rose black spot fungus affects the growth of the plant because photosynthesis is reduced.
* **c** I can describe how rose black spot fungus is spread by water and air.

* **b** I can explain how white blood cells use phagocytosis to defend against pathogens.
* **c** I can explain how white blood cells produce antibodies to defend against pathogens.
* **d** I can explain how white blood cells produce antitoxins to defend against pathogens.

##### 4.3.1.7. Vaccination

* **a** I know that a vaccine contains small quantities of dead or inactive forms of a pathogen.
* **b** I can explain how having a vaccination stimulates the white blood cells to produce antibodies against a particular pathogen and that if the same pathogen then enters the body, the white blood cells are able to respond quickly to produce the correct antibodies, preventing infection.
* **c** I can explain how the spread of pathogens can be reduced by immunising a large proportion of the population.

##### 4.3.1.8. Antibiotics and Painkillers

* **a** I know that antibiotics, such as penicillin, are medicines that help to cure bacterial disease by killing bacteria inside the body.
* **b** I know that it is important that specific bacteria should be treated by specific antibiotics.
* **c** I know that antibiotics cannot kill viral pathogens and that it is difficult to develop drugs that kill viruses without also damaging the body’s tissues.
* **d** I can describe how the use of antibiotics has greatly reduced deaths from infectious bacterial diseases, but the emergence of strains of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics is of great concern.
* **e** I know that painkillers and other medicines are used to treat the symptoms of disease but do not kill pathogens.

##### 4.3.2.1. Producing Monoclonal Antibodies

* **a** I know that monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single clone of cells.
* **b** I know that the antibodies produced are specific to one binding site on one protein antigen and so are able to target a specific chemical or specific cells in the body.
* **c** I know that specific antibodies are produced by stimulating mouse lymphocytes.
* **d** I know that the lymphocytes are combined with a kind of tumour cell to make a cell called a hybridoma cell and that this hybridoma cell can both divide and make the antibody.
* **e** I know that single hybridoma cells can be cloned to produce many identical cells that all produce the same antibody and that a large amount of the antibody can be collected and purified.
* **c** I know that malignant tumour cells are cancers. They invade neighbouring tissues and spread to different parts of the body (via the bloodstream) where they form secondary tumours.

##### 4.3.2.2. Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies

* **a** I can describe some of the ways in which monoclonal antibodies can be used, including:

  * pregnancy tests;
  * measuring the levels of hormones and other chemicals in blood, or to detect pathogens;

## Infection and Response Knowledge Organiser – Foundation and Higher 

### Page 1 of 2

#### Communicable Disease

Pathogens are microorganisms that enter the body and cause communicable disease (infectious). Plants and animals can be infected by them.

#### Viral Diseases

**Measles** is spread by droplets of liquid from sneezes and coughs etc., symptoms include a red rash on the skin and a fever. Measles can be serious or even fatal, it can lead to pneumonia. Most people are vaccinated against measles when they are very young.

**HIV** is spread by sexual contact or exchanging body fluids. HIV can be controlled be antiviral drugs; this stops the viruses replicating. The virus attacks the cells in the immune system. If the immune system is badly damaged, the body cannot cope with other infections. This is the late stage and is called aids.

**Tobacco mosaic virus** affects plants, parts of the leaves become discoloured. This means plants cannot carry out photosynthesis; this will affect the plants growth.

#### Bacterial Diseases

**Salmonella** bacteria causes food poisoning. Symptoms include fever, stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea. The symptoms are caused by the toxins produced by the bacteria. Food contaminated with salmonella can give you food poisoning. Most poultry in the UK will have had a vaccination against salmonella.

**Gonorrhoea** is a sexually transmitted bacterial disease, passed on by sexual contact. Symptoms include pain when urinating and thick yellow/green discharge from the vagina or penis. To prevent the spread, people should be treated with antibiotics and use a condom.

#### How to prevent the spread:

* **Being hygienic** – washing hands thoroughly.
* **Destroying vectors** – killing vectors by using insecticides or destroying their habitat.
* **Isolation** – isolating an infected person will prevent the spread.
* **Vaccination** – people cannot develop the infection and then pass it on.

#### Fungal and Protist Diseases

**Fungal**
Rose black spot shows as black spots on the leaves of the plant, this means less photosynthesis occurs. As a result, the plant does not grow as well. It is spread by the wind or the water. They can be treated by using fungicides and taking the leaves off the infected plant.

**Protists**
Malaria is caused by a protist, mosquitoes are the vectors. They become infected when they feed on an infected animal. The protist is inserted into the blood vessel. Malaria can cause fever, it can also be fatal.

#### Types of pathogen (descriptions)

* **Bacteria** are small cells that can reproduce very quickly in the body. They produce toxins that make you feel ill, damaging your cells and tissues.
* **Viruses** are much smaller than bacteria; they can also reproduce quickly in the body. Viruses live inside your cell where they replicate. They then burst out of the cell, releasing new viruses.
* **Protists** are eukaryotes (multicellular). Some are parasites which live on or inside other organisms, often carried by a vector.
* **Fungi** are sometimes single celled, others have hyphae that grow and penetrate human skin and the surface of plants. They can produce spores which can spread to other plants.

#### How Pathogens Are Spread

Pathogens can be spread in many ways, for example:

* **Water** – by drinking dirty water, e.g. cholera.
* **Air** – carried by air and breathed in, e.g. influenza.
* **Direct contact** – touching contaminated surfaces including the skin, e.g. athlete's foot.

**Diagram labels (page 1):** stem; hyphae; spore case (bursts); sporangium.

#### Fighting Diseases

##### Defence System

1. The skin acts as a barrier to pathogens.
2. Hairs and mucus in your nose trap particles.
3. The trachea and bronchi secrete mucus to trap pathogens. They also have cilia which move backwards and forwards to transport the mucus towards the throat. This traps any pathogens and the mucus is usually swallowed.
4. The stomach contains hydrochloric acid to kill any pathogens that enter the body via the mouth.

##### The Immune System

This kills any pathogens that enter the body.
White blood cells:

* **Phagocytosis** is when white blood cells engulf pathogens and then digest them.
* They produce **antitoxins** to neutralise the toxins.
* They also produce **antibodies**. Pathogens have **antigens** on their surface, antibodies produced by the white blood cells lock on to the antigen on the outside of the pathogen. White blood cells can then destroy the pathogens. Antibodies are specific to one antigen and will only work on that pathogen.

##### Vaccinations

Vaccinations have been developed to protect us from future infections. A vaccination involves an injection of a dead or weakened version of the pathogen. They carry antigens which cause your body to produce antibodies which will attack the pathogen. If you are infected again, the white blood cells can produce antibodies quickly.

##### Developing Drugs

There are three main stages in drug testing:

**Pre-clinical testing:**

1. Drugs are tested on human cells and tissues.
2. Testing carried out on living animals.

**Clinical testing:**
3. Tested on healthy human volunteers in clinical trials. Starts with a very low dose, then tested on people with the illness to find the optimum dose.

**Placebo** is a substance that is like the drug, but does not do anything.
**Placebo effect** is when the patient thinks the treatment will work even though their treatment isn’t doing anything.
**Blind trial** is when the patient does not know whether they are getting the drug or the placebo.
**Double-blind trial** is when both the doctor and the patient do not know whether they are getting the drug.

##### Fighting Disease – Drugs

* **Painkillers** relive the pain and symptoms, but do not tackle the cause.
* **Antibiotics** kill the bacteria causing the problem, but do not work on viruses. Viruses are very difficult to kill because they live inside the body cells.

##### Drugs from Plants

Chemicals produced by plants to defend themselves can be used to treat human diseases or help with symptoms.
New drugs are now made by chemists, who work for the pharmaceutical industry, in laboratories.

#### a) Definitions + examples

* **communicable disease:** Caused by pathogens and can be passed from one person to another. Possible examples: measles, salmonella, gonorrhoea, HIV, tobacco mosaic virus, rose black spot, malaria.
* **non-communicable disease:** Can not be passed on from one person to another. Possible examples: heart disease, diabetes, cancer.

#### b) Label the pathogens

bacteria; virus; protist; fungi

#### d) How pathogens cause disease (filled)

Bacteria reproduce rapidly by binary fission. They may produce toxins that damage tissues and make us feel ill.
Viruses take over the cells of your body. They live and rapidly reproduce inside, this causes cell damage.

#### e) Hygiene (5 examples)

* Washing hands after using the toilet, before cooking or eating, and after contact with animals or sick people.
* Using disinfectants on surfaces.
* Keeping raw meat away from food that is eaten uncooked.
* Coughing or sneezing into a tissue.
* Keeping agricultural machinery, and people using it, clean to prevent the spread of plant diseases.

#### c) Ways pathogens are spread (examples)

* By air: cold, flu, tuberculosis.
* By direct contact: malaria, STDs, HIV.
* By water: cholera, salmonellosis.

#### g) Salmonella

* Type of pathogen: bacteria
* Symptoms: Fever, abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea.
* Spread: Eating undercooked food or food contaminated from contact with raw meat, e.g. raw chicken.
* What can we do about it?: Poultry are vaccinated to control the spread.

#### f) Three other methods for preventing spread

1. Keep infected individuals in isolation.
2. Destroy the vectors that carry pathogens.
3. vaccination

#### h) Measles

* Type of pathogen: virus
* Symptoms: A fever and red rash on the skin. Can be fatal if there are complications.
* Spread: By air - the inhalation of droplets from coughs and sneezes.
* What can we do about it?: There is no treatment, so young children are vaccinated against it.

#### i) Tobacco Mosaic Virus

* Type of pathogen: virus
* Symptoms: Mosaic discolouration of the leaves which reduces photosynthesis and affects the growth of the plant.
* Spread: Direct contact between diseased plant material and healthy plants. Insects can also act as vectors.
* What can we do about it?: TMV resistant strains. Good hygiene and pest control.

#### j) Skin defence

It acts as a barrier to prevent pathogens reaching the tissues beneath. Platelets quickly form scabs to seal any cuts.
It produces antimicrobial secretions to kill pathogens.
It is covered with microorganisms that act as an extra barrier to entry.

#### k) Gonorrhoea

* Type of pathogen: bacteria
* Symptoms: Thick yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis and pain on urinating.
* Spread: Sexual contact
* What can we do about it?: Treat with antibiotics. Use a barrier method of contraception.

#### l) HIV

* Type of pathogen: virus
* Symptoms: Initially causes a flu-like illness. Damages the immune system so that it can’t deal with other infections or cancers.
* Spread: Sexual contact or exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood.
* What can we do about it?: Antiretroviral drugs help to stop the virus attacking the immune system. There is no cure or vaccine.

#### m) Respiratory system adaptations

The lining of the nose produces mucus and is full of hairs to trap particles in the air that may contain pathogens.
The lining of the trachea and bronchi produce mucus which is moved to the back of the throat by the cilia projections of epithelial cells.

(Page footer text: “Page 1 of 2”)

#### q) Digestive system adaptation

The stomach produces hydrochloric acid that destroys pathogens.

#### r) Roles of white blood cells

Some white blood cells ingest pathogens, digesting and destroying them.
Some white blood cells produce antibodies which are chemicals that target specific pathogens and destroy them. An antibody only works for one type of pathogen.
Some white blood cells produce antitoxins that counteract the toxins released by pathogens.

#### p) Vaccinations (how they prevent illness)

1. Introduce small quantities of dead or inactive virus;
2. this stimulates white blood cells to produce antibodies;
3. if the live pathogen enters the body, the white blood cells recognise it and respond quickly so you don’t get ill.

#### s) Tick boxes (answers)

|             | Treat Symptoms | Kills Bacteria | Kills Viruses |
| ----------- | -------------: | -------------: | ------------: |
| painkillers |              X |                |               |

* **antibody:** Produced by white blood cells to recognise specific antigens.
* **herd immunity:** When vaccination of a significant proportion of the population provides protection for individuals who haven’t got immunity.

#### u) Fill in the missing words (answers)

The use of antibiotics has greatly reduced the deaths from infectious bacterial diseases. However the evolution of strains that are resistant to antibiotics is a concern.
Antibiotics are specific which means they only work against certain bacteria.

#### u) Malaria

* Type of pathogen: protist
* Symptoms: Recurrent fever. Can be fatal.
* Spread: Mosquitos act as a vector, passing the protist to the human bloodstream when they feed on the blood.
* What can we do about it?: Preventing the vectors (mosquitos) from breeding.Using mosquito nets and repellents to avoid being bitten. Taking antimalarial drugs.

#### n) Rose Black Spot

* Type of pathogen: fungus
* Symptoms: Purple or black spots develop on the leaves. Leaves turn yellow and fall of prematurely which reduces photosynthesis, affecting the growth of the plant.
* Spread: Spores are carried by water or wind.
* What can we do about it?: Use fungicides to treat the plant. Remove and destroy affected leaves.

#### o) Drug testing processes

* **preclinical testing:** This happens in a laboratory using cells, tissues and animals.
* **clinical trials:** To use healthy volunteers and patients. Starting off with very low doses to check for side effects. If it is safe it is tested on patients.
* **double-blind trials:** These tell you how effective a medicine is. Neither the patient or the doctor know whether the patient has been given a placebo or the real drug.

#### v) Drug origins + discovery

* The heart drug digitalis: foxglove
* The painkiller aspirin: willow
* The antibiotic penicillin: Penicillium mould
* Who discovered penicillin? Alexander Fleming
* Why is it difficult to discover new medicines? You need to find a chemical that kills bacteria without damaging human cells.

#### w) New drugs + requirements before use

Where do most new drugs now come from?
Synthesised by chemists in a lab, but they might still start from a chemical extracted from a plant.

What has to happen before a drug can be used?

1. Test whether the drug is effective against the disease.
2. Check that the drug is not toxic.
3. Work out what dose to use.
