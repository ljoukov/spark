Topic: BIO 2023 R1 Q1 — Zeckendorf Representation

Spark Code Lesson Brief (BIO locked problem)

You are generating a Spark Code lesson. This brief is authoritative.

Exactness rules (what “exactly” means)
- When this brief says “exactly/verbatim”, preserve the original wording and numbers from this brief.
- For inputs/outputs and tests: preserve the exact tokens and the exact spacing between them.
- Output formatting for this problem: output the Zeckendorf numbers separated by single spaces on ONE line (no extra text).
- Do not add, remove, or reorder marking-scheme tests.

Session structure
- The session must contain exactly two coding problems: p1 (warm-up) and p2 (official BIO problem).
- p1 should teach the core techniques needed for p2 (Fibonacci generation, greedy decomposition, non-adjacent selection), but MUST NOT reuse the same statement or the marking tests.
- p2 MUST be the official problem below, with the same task and constraints.

Locked requirements for problem p2 (official)
- The p2 problem statement and constraints must be taken from the OFFICIAL PROBLEM section below (verbatim).
- Examples shown to the learner for p2 must use only examples already present in this brief:
  - Prefer examples and sample runs from the OFFICIAL PROBLEM section.
  - If the schema requires exactly three examples and the OFFICIAL PROBLEM has fewer than three, fill the remaining example(s) using cases from the MARKING section (still from this brief). Do not invent new examples.
- The p2 test list must be EXACTLY the MARKING tests below (same cases, same expected outputs, same order). Do not add any other tests.
- The p2 reference solution must implement the Zeckendorf representation exactly.
- The p2 reference solution must be deterministic and must match the expected output formatting exactly.

Question 1: Zeckendorf Representation
In the Fibonacci sequence each number is generated by adding the previous two numbers in the
sequence. We will start with the numbers 1 and 2, so the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …

The Zeckendorf representation of the number n consists of the distinct numbers from the Fibonacci
sequence which sum to n, where no two adjacent numbers from the Fibonacci sequence are used. There
is always a unique representation.

For example:
• 21 is represented by the single number 21;
• 21 is not represented by 8 13, even though they sum to 21, as those numbers are adjacent in the
  Fibonacci sequence;
• 100 is represented by 3 8 89.
The Zeckendorf representation for n always includes the largest number from the Fibonacci sequence
that is no greater than n.

1(a) [ 24 marks ]
Write a program that reads in a number (between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive) and
outputs the numbers (in any order) in the corresponding Zeckendorf representation.
