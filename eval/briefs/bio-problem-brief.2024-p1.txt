Spark Code Lesson Brief (BIO locked problem)

You are generating a Spark Code lesson. This brief is authoritative.

Exactness rules (what “exactly” means)
- When this brief says “exactly/verbatim”, preserve the original wording and numbers from this brief.
- For inputs/outputs and tests: preserve the exact tokens and the exact spacing between them.
- Output formatting for this problem: output the digit on ONE line (no extra text).
- Do not add, remove, or reorder marking-scheme tests.

Session structure
- The session must contain exactly two coding problems: p1 (warm-up) and p2 (official BIO problem).
- p1 should teach the core techniques needed for p2 (digit indexing in concatenated sequences, length counting), but MUST NOT reuse the same statement or the marking tests.
- p2 MUST be the official problem below, with the same task and constraints.

Locked requirements for problem p2 (official)
- The p2 problem statement and constraints must be taken from the OFFICIAL PROBLEM section below (verbatim).
- Examples shown to the learner for p2 must use only examples already present in this brief:
  - Prefer examples and sample runs from the OFFICIAL PROBLEM section.
  - If the schema requires exactly three examples and the OFFICIAL PROBLEM has fewer than three, fill the remaining example(s) using cases from the MARKING section (still from this brief). Do not invent new examples.
- The p2 test list must be EXACTLY the MARKING tests below (same cases, same expected outputs, same order). Do not add any other tests.
- The p2 reference solution must compute the ith digit correctly.
- The p2 reference solution must be deterministic and must match the expected output formatting exactly.

Question 1: Integer Strings
A string is generated by joining together, in order, all the integers starting with n. We are interested in
which digit appears in the ith position in this string.
For example:
• If we start at 6 the string will begin 678910111213141516…;
• The 11th digit in this string is 1 and the 12th is 3;
• If we start at 999 the string will begin 999100010011002… and the 10th digit is 0.
1(a) [ 25 marks ]
Write a program that reads in integers n then i (both between 1 and 259 inclusive),
indicating the first number that appears in the string and the required digit from the
string respectively. You should output the digit in the ith position in the string.
Sample run
999 11
1
