      {
        "id": "Q1",
        "prompt": "What is corrosion?",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Corrosion is the process where materials, typically metals, degrade due to chemical reactions with their environment, often involving oxygen and water. This leads to the destruction of the material's properties.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A: The destruction of a material through reactions with substances in the environment",
          "B: The process of strengthening metals by heating and cooling",
          "C: The formation of a protective layer on a metal surface",
          "D: The breaking down of a material by physical forces"
        ],

      {
        "id": "Q3",
        "prompt": "What is sacrificial protection?",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sacrificial protection involves connecting a more reactive metal (the sacrificial anode) to the metal to be protected. The more reactive metal corrodes preferentially, protecting the other metal from oxidation.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A: Adding a more reactive metal to the surface of a material",
          "B: Coating a metal with paint or grease",
          "C: Using an inert gas to prevent oxidation",

        "id": "Q6",
        "prompt": "What are gold alloys in jewellery made from?",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gold is often alloyed with other metals like copper, zinc, and silver to increase its hardness and durability for use in jewellery, as pure gold is very soft and easily scratched.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A: Gold with copper, zinc, and silver",

        "answer": "N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) = 2NH₃(g)",
        "explanation": "The Haber process synthesises ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. The balanced equation shows one molecule of nitrogen reacting with three molecules of hydrogen to produce two molecules of ammonia, ensuring conservation of atoms.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iron is used as a catalyst in the Haber process to speed up the rate of reaction without being consumed, allowing the process to be economically viable at lower temperatures and pressures than would otherwise be needed.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A: Iron",
