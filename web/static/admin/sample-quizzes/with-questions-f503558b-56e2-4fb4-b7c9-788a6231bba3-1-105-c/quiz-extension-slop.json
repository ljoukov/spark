  "prompt": "You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.\nWork in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.\nGeneral guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.\nRubric:\n- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.\n- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.\n- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.\n- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.\n- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.\n- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.\n- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.\nScoring scale:\n- 0 — no issue observed.\n- 1 — slight issue; isolated.\n- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.\n- 3 — major issue across sections.\n- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.\nDomain weighting guidance:\n- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.\n- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.\n- Other: average of the two profiles.\nWhen quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).\nFor each axis include an auto_signals array of {\"name\":<metric>,\"value\":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.\nAfter scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.\nReturn JSON only, matching the schema.\nDOMAIN: qa\nCONTEXT: This extended quiz covers 16 key chemistry concepts from the C20 section of the AQA GCSE Triple Science specification.

The questions are primarily multiple-choice with one short-answer question, offering a balanced assessment of understanding. This extension adds 10 new questions, exploring fresh angles and subtopics from the provided study material.\nMode: extension\nSubject: chemistry\nBoard: AQA\nQuestion count: 10\n\nQ1: Which of the following is a physical barrier used to protect against corrosion?\nTopic: Corrosion prevention\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Knowledge recall\nAnswer: A\nOptions:\n- A. A: Grease, paint, or a thin layer of metal\n- B. B: Sacrificial protection using a more reactive metal\n- C. C: Alloying the metal with another element\n- D. D: Electroplating with a less reactive metal\nExplanation: Physical barriers like grease, paint, or a thin layer of metal prevent oxygen and water from reaching the metal surface, thus inhibiting corrosion.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q2\n\nQ2: Rust is specifically formed through a reaction involving which three substances?\nTopic: Corrosion, Rusting\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Knowledge recall\nAnswer: B\nOptions:\n- A. A: Copper, zinc, and carbon dioxide\n- B. B: Iron, water, and oxygen\n- C. C: Aluminium, nitrogen, and hydrogen\n- D. D: Steel, acid, and heat\nExplanation: Rusting is the specific corrosion of iron, which requires both oxygen and water to occur.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q4\n\nQ3: Which pair correctly identifies two common alloys of copper?\nTopic: Alloys, Copper\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Knowledge recall\nAnswer: C\nOptions:\n- A. A: Steel and duralumin\n- B. B: Solder and pewter\n- C. C: Brass and bronze\n- D. D: Amalgam and electrum\nExplanation: Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, while bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Both are well-known copper alloys.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q5\n\nQ4: What are steel alloys primarily made from?\nTopic: Alloys, Steel\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Knowledge recall\nAnswer: A\nOptions:\n- A. A: Iron, carbon, and other metals\n- B. B: Aluminium, silicon, and oxygen\n- C. C: Copper, zinc, and tin\n- D. D: Gold, silver, and platinum\nExplanation: Steel is an alloy of iron with a small percentage of carbon, and often other elements like chromium or nickel to impart specific properties.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q7\n\nQ5: A key property of aluminium alloys that makes them useful in industries like aerospace is that they generally have:\nTopic: Alloys, Aluminium\nDifficulty: intermediate\nSkill focus: Understanding properties and uses\nAnswer: D\nOptions:\n- A. A: High melting points\n- B. B: Excellent electrical conductivity\n- C. C: Extreme hardness\n- D. D: Low densities\nExplanation: Aluminium alloys are valued for their low density, which contributes to lightweight structures, making them ideal for aircraft and vehicles.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q8\n\nQ6: What is the main difference in properties between soda-lime glass and borosilicate glass?\nTopic: Ceramics, Glass\nDifficulty: intermediate\nSkill focus: Comparing materials\nAnswer: B\nOptions:\n- A. A: Soda-lime glass is more resistant to chemical attack\n- B. B: Borosilicate glass has a much higher melting point\n- C. C: Soda-lime glass is used for laboratory equipment\n- D. D: Borosilicate glass is more easily recycled\nExplanation: Borosilicate glass (like Pyrex) contains boron oxide, which gives it a much higher melting point and better thermal shock resistance compared to soda-lime glass.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q9\n\nQ7: Which of the following pairs are examples of clay ceramics?\nTopic: Ceramics, Clay\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Knowledge recall\nAnswer: A\nOptions:\n- A.

C: Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated, while thermosoftening polymers do\n- D. D: Thermosetting polymers are formed from monomers, thermosoftening are not\nExplanation: Thermosoftening polymers have weak intermolecular forces that allow them to soften and melt when heated, whereas thermosetting polymers form strong covalent cross-links that prevent them from softening or melting.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q12\n\nQ9: What is the effect of increasing the temperature in the Haber process on the yield, rate, and cost?\nTopic: Haber process, Chemical equilibrium, Reaction kinetics\nDifficulty: higher\nSkill focus: Analyzing process conditions\nAnswer: B\nOptions:\n- A. A: Increase yield, decrease rate, decrease cost\n- B. B: Decrease yield, increase rate, increase cost\n- C. C: Increase yield, increase rate, decrease cost\n- D. D: Decrease yield, decrease rate, increase cost\nExplanation: The Haber process is an exothermic reaction, so increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing yield. However, higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of particles, leading to a faster reaction rate. Operating at higher temperatures also incurs higher energy costs.\nSource reference: C20 questions, Q17\n\nQ10: Which set of conditions is typically used for the Haber process?\nTopic: Haber process, Industrial conditions\nDifficulty: intermediate\nSkill focus: Knowledge recall of industrial processes\nAnswer: A\nOptions:\n- A.
