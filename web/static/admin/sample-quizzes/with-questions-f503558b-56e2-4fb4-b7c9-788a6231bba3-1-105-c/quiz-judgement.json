  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates high quality across all rubric dimensions. The question prompts are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, directly reflecting the source material's clarity. Answer precision is excellent, with all responses factually correct and well-grounded in the provided content, further enhanced by helpful explanations. Coverage and balance are strong, addressing key concepts from corrosion to the Haber process, with a suitable mix of question types. Difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge. Finally, the quiz adheres to safety and tone guidelines, avoiding misinformation and using correct UK English spelling.",
