  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to several rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is excellent, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and suitable for GCSE examinations. 'Answer precision' is also high, as all answers are factually correct and directly derived from the provided source material, with helpful additional explanations. The 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge from foundation recall to higher-level explanations of chemical processes. Finally, the quiz fully meets the 'Safety & tone' criteria, containing no misinformation or off-spec content and using UK English spelling. However, the 'Coverage and balance' dimension is slightly deficient due to the omission of one question (Q21) from the source image, which covers NPK fertilisers, a relevant topic for the specified syllabus. This also leads to an inaccurate statement in the quiz summary regarding coverage gaps.",

This results in incomplete coverage and an inaccurate summary statement. All questions are of the 'short_answer' type, which is consistent with the source but limits the variety of question formats for a comprehensive quiz."

      "explanation": "The judge correctly identifies that the candidate quiz omits question 21 from the source material, which is about NPK fertilisers. This omission justifies a score reduction for 'Coverage and balance' and supports the 'revise' verdict. However, the judge's reasoning is flawed. The judge states that the omission leads to 'an inaccurate statement in the quiz summary regarding coverage gaps'. This is incorrect. The candidate's summary explicitly and accurately states: 'Coverage gaps: NPK fertilisers are not covered.' The candidate correctly identified and declared the omission. The judge has misread the summary and penalised the candidate for being transparent, which is a significant error in the evaluation.",
