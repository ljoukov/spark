    "summary": "This quiz covers 6 key concepts from AQA GCSE Chemistry, focusing on topics such as corrosion, alloys, the Haber process, and fertilisers. It includes a mix of short answer and multiple-choice questions designed to test recall and understanding. One question on the Haber process equation has been corrected to ensure chemical accuracy. The questions are directly extracted from the provided C20 retrieval material.",

        "prompt": "What is corrosion?",
        "answer": "The destruction of a material through reactions with substances in the environment.",
        "explanation": "Corrosion is a natural process that converts a refined metal into a more stable form, such as its oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide. It is the gradual destruction of materials (usually metals) by chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment.",

        "answer": "N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) = 2NH₃(g)",
        "explanation": "The Haber process combines nitrogen gas (N₂) from the air with hydrogen gas (H₂) to produce ammonia (NH₃). The balanced equation requires one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen to form two molecules of ammonia.",

        "explanation": "Sacrificial protection involves connecting a more reactive metal (the sacrificial anode) to the metal being protected. The more reactive metal corrodes preferentially, thereby protecting the less reactive metal.",
