  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is high, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, effectively building upon the original source material. 'Answer precision' is consistently strong, providing factually correct and well-justified responses that are directly grounded in the material. The 'Coverage and balance' are commendable, addressing key concepts from the C20 'Chemical and Allied Industries' topic with a suitable mix of short answer and multiple-choice questions. 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge from foundation recall to higher-level analytical questions, particularly in the Haber process section. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are maintained throughout, with no misinformation or off-spec content, and correct UK English spelling.",
