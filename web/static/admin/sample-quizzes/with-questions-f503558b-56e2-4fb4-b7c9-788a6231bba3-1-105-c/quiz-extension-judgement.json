Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates strong adherence to `Question quality` and `Answer precision`, with prompts that are clear, unambiguous, and factually correct, directly aligning with the provided source material. The `Difficulty alignment` is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge. Furthermore, the `Safety & tone` are excellent, with no off-spec or harmful content. However, the quiz falls short in `Coverage and balance` due to significant inaccuracies in its `summary` and `mode` fields, which misrepresent the quiz's content and structure.",

The 'mode' as 'extension' is also misleading given this context."

      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The judge correctly identifies that while the questions and answers are high quality and factually correct based on the source material, the quiz's metadata contains significant errors. The `summary` misstates the number of questions (claiming 16 when there are 10), incorrectly claims a short-answer question is included, and falsely describes the questions as 'new' and the quiz as an 'extension' when they are direct conversions from the source. These inaccuracies fully justify the low score for 'Coverage and balance' and the overall 'revise' verdict.",
