        "answer": "A) Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated, thermosoftening polymers do",
        "explanation": "Thermosoftening polymers soften and melt when heated because their intermolecular forces are overcome, allowing them to be reshaped. Thermosetting polymers form permanent cross-links during their initial heating and curing, which prevents them from softening or melting upon subsequent heating.",

        "answer": "A) Decrease yield, increase rate, increase cost",
        "explanation": "The Haber process is an exothermic reaction. Increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left (reactants), thus decreasing the yield of ammonia. However, higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of reactant particles, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions, which increases the reaction rate. Operating at higher temperatures also requires more energy input, increasing the overall cost.",
