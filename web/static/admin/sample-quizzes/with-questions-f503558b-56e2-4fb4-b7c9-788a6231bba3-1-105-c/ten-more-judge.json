    "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is consistently high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready. Answer precision is flawless, as all answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the provided C20 retrieval material. The coverage and balance are appropriate for an extension quiz, addressing key concepts across various topics within the C20 chapter, including corrosion, alloys, ceramics, polymers, composites, and the Haber process. Difficulty alignment is well-managed, with questions appropriately categorised from 'foundation' to 'higher' to suit GCSE Triple Science. Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate safety and tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content, and uses UK English spelling.",
