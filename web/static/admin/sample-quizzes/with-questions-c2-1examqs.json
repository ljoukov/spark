    "summary": "This quiz covers key concepts from AQA GCSE Chemistry, focusing on states of matter, the particle model, chemical equations, and experimental techniques for determining melting and boiling points. It includes a mix of question types: three multiple-choice questions testing data interpretation and conceptual understanding, and three short-answer questions requiring recall, application of knowledge, and scientific reasoning. Questions range in difficulty from foundation to higher, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of understanding. Note: One multiple-choice question (Q2a) was adapted from an original 'tick two boxes' format to fit the single-answer schema.",

        "answer": "aq, g",

Substance C is liquid from approx. 10°C to 200°C (range 190°C). Substance D is liquid from approx. -175°C to -125°C (range 50°C).

        "explanation": "At 50°C, substance A (boiling point approx. 0°C) and substance D (boiling point approx. -125°C) would both have already boiled and therefore be in a gaseous state. Substance B (melting point approx. 75°C) would be solid, and substance C (boiling point approx. 200°C) would be liquid.",

        "answer": "The apparatus uses a water bath. Water boils at 100°C, which is lower than the boiling point of substance B (approximately 190°C). Therefore, the water bath cannot reach a high enough temperature to boil substance B.",
        "explanation": "A water bath can only heat substances up to the boiling point of water, which is 100°C. Substance B has a boiling point of approximately 190°C, as shown in Figure 1. Since 100°C is significantly lower than 190°C, the water bath cannot provide enough heat to make substance B boil, making it unsuitable for determining its boiling point.",
