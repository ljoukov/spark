    {
      "id": "Q11",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "According to the biological organisation hierarchy presented, define a 'Tissue'.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "A group of cells with similar structure and function, working together"
      ],
      "explanation": "A Tissue is defined as a group of cells with similar structure and function, working together. This forms the second level of organization, larger than a cell but smaller than an organ.",
      "hint": "Recall the definitions for the structural hierarchy starting from the smallest unit of life."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q12",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "Fats are difficult for the digestive system to break down because they form large globules and do not mix well with water. Which substance acts as an emulsifier to address these issues?",
      "options": [
        "Enzymes secreted by the pancreas",
        "Hydrochloric acid",
        "Bile",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bile, produced by the liver, is an emulsifier. It breaks down large fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing the surface area for lipase enzymes to work effectively (Page 37).",
      "hint": "This substance is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q13",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "Besides emulsification, state the other major chemical function of bile in the small intestine.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "Neutralise stomach acid",
        "Neutralize stomach acid"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bile has two main functions: emulsify fats and neutralise stomach acid. Neutralising the acid helps create the optimum pH conditions for enzymes in the small intestine to work (Page 36/44).",
      "hint": "The stomach uses acid; bile helps change the pH condition of the food entering the small intestine."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q14",
      "type": "true_false",
      "prompt": "Chemical digestion uses acids and enzymes to break down food into smaller pieces, whereas mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of food.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "True"
      ],
      "explanation": "The material defines chemical digestion as using enzymes and acids to break food into smaller molecules, and mechanical digestion as the physical breakdown, such as chewing or churning (Page 18/19).",
      "hint": "Consider the difference between a physical process (like tearing) and a chemical process (like dissolving)."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q15",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "Where is bile stored before it is secreted into the small intestine?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "Gallbladder",
        "The gallbladder"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder (Page 36).",
      "hint": "It is a small organ attached to the liver."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q16",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "Which of the following is an adaptation of the villi that is critical for maintaining a short pathway for nutrient movement into the bloodstream?",
      "options": [
        "Villi cells having many mitochondria",
        "The small intestine having a large surface area overall",
        "Capillaries being close to the surface of the villi",
        "The presence of microvilli"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "The indicative content mentions that capillaries are close to the surface, resulting in a short pathway, which speeds up absorption (Page 31, point 3).",
      "hint": "Think about how close the transport network needs to be to the absorption point."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q17",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "Why do the cells lining the villi contain many mitochondria?",
      "options": [
        "To provide energy for the process of active transport required to absorb sugar molecules",
        "To neutralise the stomach acid present in the small intestine",
        "To create the necessary surface area for diffusion",
        "To produce enzymes that break down proteins and fats"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "A"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mitochondria are the site where respiration takes place and energy is transferred. This energy is needed because active transport requires energy to absorb certain molecules like sugar/food molecules (Page 31, Indicative content).",
      "hint": "Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, supplying energy for processes that require it."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q18",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "State the structure responsible for churning or mixing food in the stomach, which contributes to mechanical digestion.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "Stomach muscles",
        "Churning in the stomach"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mechanical digestion includes 'chewing or churning in the stomach,' which is carried out by the stomach muscles mixing the food (Page 19 and 20).",
      "hint": "Think about what physical part of the stomach causes the mixing motion."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q19",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "What is the primary function of the large intestine?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "Absorption of excess water"
      ],
      "explanation": "The large intestine's primary role is the 'Absorption of excess water, leading to egestion of undigested food' (Page 32).",
      "hint": "This organ determines the final composition of waste before egestion."

      "id": "Q20",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "The definition of an Organ is:",
      "options": [
        "A group of organs working together to perform a function.",
        "A group of tissues working together to form a structure with a particular function.",
        "The smallest unit of life.",
        "A series of organ systems which together form a living organism."
      ],
      "answer": [
        "B"
      ],
      "explanation": "An organ is defined as 'A group of tissues working together to form a structure with a particular function' (Page 10/11).",
      "hint": "An organ is composed of several types of the next level down in the hierarchy."
