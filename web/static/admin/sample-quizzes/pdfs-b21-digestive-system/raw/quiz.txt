      "answer": [
        "D"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of food, such as chewing in the mouth or the churning performed by the stomach muscles.",
      "hint": "The other type of digestion involves enzymes and acids.",

      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "true"
      ],
      "explanation": "Chemical digestion involves catalysts (enzymes) and chemical substances (acids, like stomach acid) to break down complex food molecules into smaller molecules.",
      "hint": "Chemical processes change the actual structure of the substance being digested.",
      "sourceReference": "Page 19, Chemical Digestion"
    },
    {
      "id": "Q6",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "What are the two most significant functions performed by the small intestine?",
      "options": [
        "Storage of waste and final water absorption.",
        "Mechanical breakdown and acid secretion.",
        "Completion of digestion and absorption of nutrients.",
        "Production of bile and neutralisation of stomach acid."
      ],
      "answer": [
        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "The small intestine is the site where digestion is completed and where the absorption of nutrients (such as digested carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) into the bloodstream occurs.",
      "hint": "The large intestine performs the primary absorption of water.",
      "sourceReference": "Page 26, Small intestine description"
    },
    {
      "id": "Q7",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "Name the organ responsible for the production of bile.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "Liver"
      ],
      "explanation": "Bile is produced by the liver before being stored in the gallbladder, and its primary role is to aid fat digestion.",
      "hint": "This organ is often linked to detoxification processes in the body.",
      "sourceReference": "Page 36; Page 44, Q1"
    },
    {
      "id": "Q8",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "Bile acts as an emulsifier in the small intestine. What is the effect of emulsification?",
      "options": [
        "It chemically breaks down protein molecules into amino acids.",
        "It neutralises the acids entering the small intestine from the stomach.",
        "It breaks large fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing surface area.",
        "It transports nutrients directly into the body's main circulatory system."
      ],
      "answer": [
        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "Emulsification breaks down large fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing the surface area for lipase enzymes to digest the fat more efficiently.",
      "hint": "The key challenge with fats is their small surface area relative to their volume and their inability to mix with water.",
      "sourceReference": "Page 36, Point 1; Page 37"

    {
      "id": "Q9",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "In terms of maintaining a concentration gradient, why is a good blood supply crucial for the efficient absorption of nutrients by the villi?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "Transports absorbed food molecules away from the small intestine"
      ],
      "explanation": "The rich blood supply transports nutrients away rapidly, maintaining a low concentration of nutrients in the blood supply, which in turn maintains a steep diffusion gradient from the small intestine lumen into the blood.",
      "hint": "Diffusion requires a difference in concentration.",
      "sourceReference": "Page 31, Indicative content (good blood supply)"
    },
    {
      "id": "Q10",
      "type": "true_false",
      "prompt": "The thin walls of the villi, which are only one cell thick, increase the distance over which nutrients must diffuse to enter the blood.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": [
        "false"
      ],
      "explanation": "The walls of the villi are thin (just one cell thick) to ensure a short diffusion distance, which maximises the rate at which nutrients can be absorbed quickly into the blood.",
      "hint": "A short pathway means diffusion happens faster.",
