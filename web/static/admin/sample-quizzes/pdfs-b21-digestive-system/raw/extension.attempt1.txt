    {
      "id": "ext_bio_001",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "According to the structural hierarchy presented, what is defined as the smallest unit of life?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": ["Cell"],
      "explanation": "The hierarchy starts with the Cell, which is defined as the smallest unit of life (Page 10, 11).",
      "hint": "This term is at the very beginning of the organisation ladder."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_002",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "Which statement correctly defines an Organ within the context of biological organisation?",
      "options": [
        "A group of cells with similar structure and function, working together.",
        "A series of organ systems which together form a living organism.",
        "A group of tissues working together to form a structure with a particular function."
      ],
      "answer": ["C"],
      "explanation": "An organ is defined as a group of tissues working together to form a structure with a particular function (Page 10, 11).",
      "hint": "This level is formed by combining tissues."

    {
      "id": "ext_bio_003",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "Besides chewing, identify a specific mechanical process that occurs in the stomach to aid physical breakdown of food.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": ["Churning", "Stomach muscles mixing food"],
      "explanation": "Mechanical digestion involves the physical breakdown of food, such as chewing or churning in the stomach (Page 19, 20).",
      "hint": "It involves the muscular action of the stomach itself."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_004",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "For digestion to be effective, both of which two types of processes are required?",
      "options": [
        "Chemical",
        "Absorption",
        "Mechanical",
        "Diffusion"
      ],
      "answer": ["A", "C"],
      "explanation": "Both mechanical digestion (physical breakdown) and chemical digestion (using enzymes and acids) are essential for effective digestion (Page 19).",
      "hint": "Think of the difference between chewing and using enzymes."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_005",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "What is the primary role of the large intestine?",
      "options": [
        "Mixing food with enzymes and acids.",
        "Digestion and absorption of major nutrients like carbohydrates and proteins.",
        "Absorption of excess water, leading to egestion of undigested food."
      ],
      "answer": ["C"],
      "explanation": "The large intestine absorbs excess water, which leads to the egestion (removal) of undigested food (Page 32).",
      "hint": "This organ determines the final composition of waste before excretion."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_006",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "Name the small projections found in the small intestine that contribute to a large surface area for absorption.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": ["Villi"],
      "explanation": "The small intestine has small projections called villi, which increase the surface area for digestion and absorption (Page 26, 29).",
      "hint": "These structures are key to the 'large surface area' adaptation."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_007",
      "type": "true_false",
      "prompt": "Fats are difficult to digest because they form large globules with a small surface area and do not mix well with the water-based digestive system.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": ["True"],
      "explanation": "Fats form large globules (small surface area) and do not mix well with water, making it hard for enzymes to digest them (Page 35).",
      "hint": "Consider the challenges of mixing oil and water."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_008",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "Besides emulsifying fats, what is the second key function bile performs to aid digestion?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": ["Neutralise stomach acid", "Neutralise acidic conditions"],
      "explanation": "Bile works to 1. Emulsify fats, and 2. Neutralise stomach acid (Page 36, 44).",
      "hint": "This process ensures the conditions are suitable for enzymes operating downstream of the stomach."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_009",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "prompt": "The adaptation of having capillaries close to the villi surface immediately contributes to which benefit for nutrient absorption?",
      "options": [
        "It increases the overall volume of blood supply.",
        "It creates a large surface area for nutrient exchange.",
        "It ensures a short pathway for diffused material."
      ],
      "answer": ["C"],
      "explanation": "Capillaries being close to the surface results in a short pathway, meaning material can be absorbed (diffuse) really quickly (Page 29, 31).",
      "hint": "This relates directly to minimising the travel distance for nutrient molecules."
    },
    {
      "id": "ext_bio_010",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "prompt": "State the fundamental reason provided in the material for why we study the digestive system.",
      "options": [],
      "answer": ["Absorbing nutrients allows our bodies to function."],
      "explanation": "The learning material repeatedly states: 'We are learning this because absorbing nutrients allows our bodies to function.' (Page 1, 9).",
      "hint": "This justification is listed under the 'We are learning this because...' section."
