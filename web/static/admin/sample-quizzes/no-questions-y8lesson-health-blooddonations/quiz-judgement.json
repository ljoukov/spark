  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates strong question quality and answer precision, with all prompts being clear, unambiguous, and factually correct, directly referencing the provided material. The safety and tone are excellent, adhering to educational standards. However, the coverage and balance could be improved as the quiz does not fully address all learning intentions, specifically omitting questions on the detailed steps involved in organ donation and the definitions of the various donation types. The difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable mix of foundation and intermediate questions.",

      "explanation": "I agree with the judge's verdict. The assessment is accurate and well-reasoned. The judge correctly identifies that while the quiz has high-quality questions and precise answers, it fails to fully cover the learning intentions outlined in the source material. Specifically, the judge rightly points out the omission of questions regarding the steps of organ donation (detailed on page 11) and the definitions of the different donation types (a task set on page 3). The positive scores for question quality, answer precision, difficulty, and safety are also appropriate, as the existing questions are well-constructed and factually sound.",
