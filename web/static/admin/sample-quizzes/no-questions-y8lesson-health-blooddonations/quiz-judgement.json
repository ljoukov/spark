Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last.

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong question quality, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and suitable for a GCSE exam context. Answer precision is also excellent, as all answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material, with accurate source references. The quiz's difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge from recall to understanding. However, the quiz has a notable gap in its coverage and balance, as it explicitly states that it does not assess the learning intention 'Analyse considerations involved in an individual's choice to donate', which is a key component of the source material. This omission prevents a comprehensive assessment of the topic.",

          "justification": "While the quiz covers key concepts related to the importance, steps, and law of donation, it explicitly omits questions addressing the learning intention 'Analyse considerations involved in an individual's choice to donate'. This is a significant gap, as the source material dedicates several pages (14-17) to this aspect, including reasons for choosing to donate or not to donate, and reflections on ethical considerations. The mix of question types (numeric, multiple choice, true/false, short answer) is good, but the content coverage is incomplete."

The current questions provide a suitable variation in challenge. Including questions on 'Analyse considerations' would further enhance the higher-order thinking skills assessed."

    "result": {
      "explanation": "The judge's verdict to 'revise' is well-founded and accurately reflects the quiz's shortcomings. The primary justification, a significant gap in 'Coverage and balance', is correct. The quiz explicitly omits the learning intention 'Analyse considerations involved in an individual's choice to donate', despite this being a key focus of pages 14-17 of the source material. The candidate's rationale for this omission (that the material is for discussion) is weak, as page 16 provides concrete, testable examples of reasons not to donate. The judge's high scores for question quality and answer precision are also appropriate, as the existing questions are well-crafted and factually correct. The overall assessment is sound, leading to a justified 'revise' verdict.",
