  "prompt": "You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.\nWork in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.\nGeneral guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.\nRubric:\n- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.\n- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.\n- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.\n- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.\n- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.\n- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.\n- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.\nScoring scale:\n- 0 — no issue observed.\n- 1 — slight issue; isolated.\n- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.\n- 3 — major issue across sections.\n- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.\nDomain weighting guidance:\n- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.\n- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.\n- Other: average of the two profiles.\nWhen quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).\nFor each axis include an auto_signals array of {\"name\":<metric>,\"value\":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.\nAfter scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.\nReturn JSON only, matching the schema.\nDOMAIN: qa\nCONTEXT: This quiz covers key aspects of blood, organ, and stem cell donation, aligning with GCSE Biology (OCR specification).
