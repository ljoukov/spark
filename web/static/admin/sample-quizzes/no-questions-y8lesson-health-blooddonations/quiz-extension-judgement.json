Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates good coverage and balance, addressing key concepts related to blood, organ, and stem cell donation with a suitable mix of question types (multiple-choice, short-answer, true/false). The difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge from recall to interpretation. However, there is a significant issue with question quality and answer precision in one item, leading to misinformation.",

          "score": 0.6,
          "justification": "Most prompts are precise and unambiguous. However, Question 10 is poorly phrased and ambiguous. It asks if someone 'whose organs have been damaged by disease or injury is a candidate for organ donation'. This is incorrect; such a person would be a recipient, not a donor candidate. This makes the prompt misleading."

          "criterion": "Answer precision",
          "score": 0.6,
          "justification": "The answer for Question 10 is factually incorrect based on the prompt's wording. The explanation correctly cites the material showing that individuals with damaged organs 'might need organ donation', but the question asks if they are a 'candidate for organ donation', which is the opposite. This represents a significant factual error in the quiz's logic."

          "justification": "The quiz effectively covers the learning intentions, including reasons for donation, steps involved in different types of donation, legal aspects, and considerations for choice. There is a good balance of question types (multiple-choice, short-answer, true/false)."

          "score": 0.5,
          "justification": "The quiz generally maintains an appropriate tone and avoids harmful content. However, the factual inaccuracy in Question 10 regarding who is a 'candidate for organ donation' constitutes misinformation, which is a safety concern in an educational context."

    "result": {
      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and factually accurate. The core issue identified in Question 10 is significant: the prompt incorrectly frames a person who needs an organ (a recipient) as a 'candidate for organ donation' (a donor). The quiz's answer, 'True', is therefore factually incorrect. The judge correctly points out this misinformation, which justifies the low scores for 'Question quality', 'Answer precision', and 'Safety & tone'. The high scores for 'Coverage and balance' and 'Difficulty alignment' are also appropriate, as the rest of the quiz is well-constructed. The overall 'revise' verdict is a direct and logical consequence of these findings.",
