  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent adherence to all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is consistently high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is flawless, as all answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material. The 'Coverage and balance' are appropriate for the topic, addressing various aspects of blood, organ, and stem cell donation, including procedural details, statistics, and legal frameworks, with a suitable mix of question types. 'Difficulty alignment' is well-managed, offering a range of challenges from direct recall to interpretation, suitable for GCSE Triple Science. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are maintained throughout, with no misinformation or off-spec content.",
