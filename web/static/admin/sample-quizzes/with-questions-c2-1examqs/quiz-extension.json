        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The numbers in front of the chemical formulas (coefficients) show the ratio. There is a '2' in front of Li and an unwritten '1' in front of H₂, so the ratio is 2:1.",

        "answer": "115",

        "explanation": "By estimating the ranges: A is ~75°C, B is ~115°C, C is ~200°C, and D is ~20°C (-160 - (-180)). Substance D has the smallest liquid range.",

        "answer": "Oil has a much higher boiling point than water, so it can be heated to the 190°C required to boil substance B, whereas the water bath cannot go above 100°C.",
        "explanation": "A water bath is limited by the boiling point of water (100°C). Since substance B boils at approximately 190°C, an oil bath, which can reach higher temperatures, is required to supply enough energy for it to boil.",
