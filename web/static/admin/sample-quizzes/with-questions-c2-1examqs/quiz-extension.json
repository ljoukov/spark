        "answer": "The thermometer is placed in the water bath, not directly in substance B, meaning it measures the water temperature rather than the substance's temperature directly. OR The water bath provides indirect heating, which may not ensure uniform or precise temperature measurement of substance B.",
        "explanation": "For an exact melting point, the thermometer should be immersed directly into the substance being measured. In Figure 2, the thermometer is in the water, which acts as a heating medium, but does not directly measure the temperature of substance B itself, leading to potential inaccuracies.",
