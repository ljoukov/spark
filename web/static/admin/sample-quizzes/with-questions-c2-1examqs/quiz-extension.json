    "quizTitle": "GCSE Chemistry: States of Matter and Reactions",
    "summary": "This quiz covers fundamental concepts in GCSE Chemistry, focusing on states of matter, particle theory, and chemical reactions. It includes questions on interpreting phase change diagrams, applying state symbols in chemical equations, evaluating experimental setups, and understanding the characteristics of particles in different states. The questions are a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer formats, designed to test both knowledge recall and application skills, aligning with AQA GCSE Chemistry specifications.",

        "id": "Q_new_1",
        "prompt": "Based on Figure 1, what is the state of substance B at 100°C?",
        "answer": "Liquid",
        "explanation": "From Figure 1, substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C and a boiling point of approximately 190°C. Since 100°C is above its melting point but below its boiling point, substance B will be in the liquid state.",

        "id": "Q_new_2",
        "prompt": "For a given material, in which state of matter do the particles have the most kinetic energy?",
        "answer": "Gas",
        "explanation": "Particles in the gaseous state have the highest kinetic energy because they are moving rapidly and randomly, with large distances between them, allowing for greater freedom of movement compared to liquids or solids.",

        "answer": "Solid",
        "explanation": "Substance E has a melting point of -50°C. At -75°C, the temperature is below its melting point, meaning it will be in the solid state.",

        "prompt": "Suggest one reason why the student could not use the apparatus in Figure 2 to determine the exact melting point of substance B.",
        "answer": "The thermometer is in the water, not directly in substance B, so it measures the water temperature, not the substance's temperature. There might be a temperature difference between the water and substance B.",
        "explanation": "For an exact measurement, the thermometer should be immersed directly into the substance whose melting point is being determined. In Figure 2, the thermometer is in the water bath, which may not be at the exact same temperature as substance B, leading to an inaccurate reading for substance B's melting point.",

        "prompt": "Which of the following best describes the arrangement of particles in a liquid?",
        "answer": "Closely packed but able to slide past each other",
        "explanation": "In a liquid, particles are still relatively close together but are not held in fixed positions like in a solid. They can move and slide past one another, which is why liquids can flow and take the shape of their container.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",

        "id": "Q_new_6",
        "prompt": "Describe how the movement of particles changes when a liquid turns into a gas.",
        "answer": "When a liquid turns into a gas, the particles gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them. They move much faster, become widely spaced, and move randomly and chaotically throughout the entire volume available.",
        "explanation": "As a liquid is heated to its boiling point, particles absorb energy, increasing their kinetic energy. This allows them to break free from the intermolecular forces holding them in a relatively fixed volume, leading to a transition to the gaseous state where particles are far apart and move with high speed and randomness.",

        "explanation": "From Figure 1: Substance A has a melting point of approximately -10°C. Substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C. Substance C has a melting point of approximately 10°C. Substance D has a melting point of approximately -180°C. Of these, -10°C (Substance A) is closest to 0°C.",

        "answer": "The balls would be more closely packed and move more slowly than in a gas.",
        "explanation": "In a liquid, particles are more closely packed than in a gas, and while they can move past each other, their movement is less energetic and random compared to gas particles. They would have less kinetic energy than gas particles, but not be in fixed positions like a solid.",
