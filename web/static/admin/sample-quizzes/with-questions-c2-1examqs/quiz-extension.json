        "answer": "Lithium is a solid",
        "explanation": "The state symbol (s) stands for solid. The equation shows that solid lithium reacts with liquid water.",

        "answer": "2:1",
        "explanation": "The numbers in front of the chemical formulas (coefficients) show the ratio. There is a '2' in front of Li and an implied '1' in front of H₂, so the ratio is 2:1.",

        "answer": "An oil bath",
        "explanation": "A water bath cannot exceed 100°C. To reach higher temperatures like 190°C safely, an oil bath or sand bath is used, as oil has a much higher boiling point than water.",

A) The Bunsen burner flame is yellow, B) Reading the thermometer from an angle, C) Using distilled water in the bath, D) The test tube is too clean.",
        "answer": "Reading the thermometer from an angle",

A) They move randomly and have high kinetic energy, B) They slide past each other and have medium kinetic energy, C) They are stationary and have no kinetic energy, D) They vibrate about fixed positions and have low kinetic energy.",
        "answer": "They vibrate about fixed positions and have low kinetic energy",
        "explanation": "In the solid state, particles are held in a fixed, regular arrangement (a lattice). They possess kinetic energy, but it is not enough to overcome the forces of attraction, so their movement is restricted to vibrations around their fixed positions.",

A) The balls are too colourful, B) The model does not represent the forces of attraction between particles, C) The balls move too randomly, D) The balls are too far apart.",
        "answer": "The model does not represent the forces of attraction between particles",
        "explanation": "Real gas particles have weak intermolecular forces of attraction between them. The solid balls in the model do not have any equivalent forces, which is a significant way in which the model is inaccurate.",

        "answer": "It remains constant",
        "explanation": "During a phase change like melting, the energy being supplied (latent heat) is used to overcome the forces holding the particles in their fixed positions (increasing their potential energy), not to increase their speed. Therefore, the temperature, which is a measure of the average kinetic energy, remains constant until all the solid has melted.",
