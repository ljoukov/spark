  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates strong 'Answer precision', with all responses being factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material. 'Difficulty alignment' is also appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge. Furthermore, 'Safety & tone' are excellent, with no misinformation or off-spec content. However, the quiz requires revision due to issues with 'Question quality' in one instance and 'Coverage and balance' as several questions from the source material were omitted.",

      "explanation": "The judge's verdict to 'revise' is defensible, primarily due to the valid point raised under 'Coverage and balance'. The candidate quiz did omit several extractable questions from the source material (Q1f and the second part of Q2b). However, the judge's reasoning for downgrading 'Question quality' is flawed. The judge criticized the adaptation of question 2a from a 'tick two' format to a multiple-choice question, calling it 'inconsistent' and 'ambiguous'. This adaptation, where the correct option combines the two correct statements, is a standard and clear way to convert a multi-select question into a single-choice format. It is not ambiguous. Because the judge's reasoning is partially incorrect, the overall judgement needs review.",
