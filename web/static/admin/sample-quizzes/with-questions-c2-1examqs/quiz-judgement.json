  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates strong Question quality with precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready prompts. Answer precision is excellent, with all answers factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material. The Difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge levels from foundation to higher-tier questions. Furthermore, the quiz adheres to Safety & tone guidelines, avoiding any misinformation or off-spec content. However, the Coverage and balance of the quiz is significantly limited by the very narrow scope of the source document, resulting in a heavy concentration on states of matter and particle theory, with insufficient representation of other key GCSE Triple Science topics.",

          "justification": "While the quiz offers a good mix of question types (short answer, multiple choice, numeric) and covers key concepts within the provided text (states of matter, particle model, experimental techniques), its overall coverage for GCSE Triple Science is extremely narrow. It lacks breadth across the broader syllabus, focusing almost exclusively on a single topic area due to the limited source material."

          "justification": "The questions demonstrate a suitable range of difficulty, from foundation-level recall to intermediate graph interpretation and higher-level analytical tasks, appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. A slight deduction for the high number of very similar graph-reading questions, which could be seen as slightly repetitive in terms of skill assessment."

      "explanation": "The judge's analysis of the quiz's qualities is largely accurate. The quiz does have excellent question quality and answer precision, but its topical coverage is very narrow. However, the judge's final verdict of 'revise' is inappropriate. The quiz is in 'extraction' mode, meaning the candidate is constrained by the provided source document. The source itself is extremely narrow, focusing only on states of matter. The candidate has done an exceptional job of extracting a high volume of varied and high-quality questions from this limited material, and even correctly identified the coverage limitation in the quiz summary. The narrowness is a flaw of the source, not the candidate's work. Therefore, the quiz should be considered acceptable, as it represents a successful execution of the task within its given constraints.",
