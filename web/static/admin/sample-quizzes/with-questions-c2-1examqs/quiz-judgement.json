  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

    "verdict": {
      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates good 'Answer precision' and adheres to 'Safety & tone' guidelines. However, it requires significant revisions primarily due to issues with 'Question quality' and 'Coverage and balance'. Several questions from the source material have been omitted or substantially altered, changing the intended assessment of skills and knowledge. This impacts the overall fidelity to the original quiz and its comprehensive coverage of the topics.",

          "criterion": "Question quality",
          "score": 0.5,
          "justification": "While individual prompts are precise, the quiz deviates significantly from the source material. Question 1(d) was changed from a plotting task to a multiple-choice question, and Question 2(a) was changed from a 'tick two boxes' format to a single-choice multiple-choice question. This alters the nature and intent of the original questions."

        {
          "criterion": "Coverage and balance",
          "score": 0.3,
          "justification": "The quiz suffers from poor coverage and balance as two questions (1f and 2b) from the original source material are entirely missing. Additionally, the alteration of question types for 1(d) and 2(a) means that certain skills (e.g., plotting on a graph, identifying multiple characteristics) are not assessed as intended by the source paper."

        {
          "criterion": "Difficulty alignment",
          "score": 0.7,
          "justification": "The questions that are present are generally appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. However, the omission of certain questions and the simplification of others (e.g., changing a plotting task to a conceptual multiple-choice) reduce the overall variation in challenge and the range of higher-order thinking skills tested by the original paper."

    "result": {
      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The judge correctly identifies that the candidate quiz significantly alters the source material by changing question types (e.g., changing a plotting question 1d into a multiple-choice question) and simplifying others (changing a 'tick two' question 2a into a single-choice question). The judge also correctly notes the complete omission of questions 1f and 2b. These changes fundamentally impact the skills being assessed and the coverage of the original quiz, justifying the low scores for 'Question quality' and 'Coverage and balance' and the overall 'revise' verdict.",
