  "prompt": "You are a meticulous copy editor. Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.\nWork in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.\nGeneral guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.\nRubric:\n- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.\n- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.\n- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.\n- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.\n- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.\n- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.\n- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.\nScoring scale:\n- 0 — no issue observed.\n- 1 — slight issue; isolated.\n- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.\n- 3 — major issue across sections.\n- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.\nDomain weighting guidance:\n- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.\n- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.\n- Other: average of the two profiles.\nWhen quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).\nFor each axis include an auto_signals array of {\"name\":<metric>,\"value\":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.\nAfter scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.\nReturn JSON only, matching the schema.\nDOMAIN: qa\nCONTEXT: This extended quiz covers key concepts in GCSE Chemistry, focusing on states of matter, changes of state, interpretation of melting and boiling point data from graphs, experimental techniques for determining these points, the particle model of gases, and basic chemical equation analysis.

A) LiO\n- B. B) LiOH\n- C. C) LiH2O\n- D. D) Li2O\nExplanation: The chemical equation explicitly states '2LiOH' as a product, which is the formula for lithium hydroxide.\nSource reference: Page 1, Question 1(a)\n\nQ3: Based on Figure 1, which substance is a solid at 0 °C?\nTopic: States of matter and changes of state\nDifficulty: intermediate\nSkill focus: Data analysis, graph interpretation\nAnswer: B) B\nOptions:\n- A. A) A\n- B. B) B\n- C. C) C\n- D. D) D\nExplanation: Substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C. Since 0°C is below its melting point, substance B would be in a solid state at this temperature.\nSource reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1\n\nQ4: According to Figure 1, what is the approximate boiling point of substance B?\nTopic: States of matter and changes of state\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Data extraction from graph\nAnswer: C) 190 °C\nOptions:\n- A. A) 70 °C\n- B. B) 100 °C\n- C. C) 190 °C\n- D. D) 200 °C\nExplanation: By reading the graph for substance B, the boiling point (marked with a solid circle) is approximately 190°C.\nSource reference: Page 2, Question 1(b), Figure 1\n\nQ5: Based on Figure 1, what is the approximate melting point of substance A?\nTopic: States of matter and changes of state\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Data extraction from graph\nAnswer: B) -20 °C\nOptions:\n- A.

A) Solid\n- B. B) Liquid\n- C. C) Gas\n- D. D) Plasma\nExplanation: Gas particles have the highest kinetic energy because they are far apart and move rapidly and randomly, colliding frequently with each other and the container walls.\nSource reference: Page 5, Question 2(b)\n\nQ10: A student shakes a tube containing small balls to model the movement of particles in a gas. Besides being far apart, which other characteristic of gas particle movement does this model effectively demonstrate?\nTopic: Particle model, states of matter\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Understanding models, recall of gas properties\nAnswer: C) The particles move randomly\nOptions:\n- A. A) The particles move slowly\n- B. B) The particles are in fixed positions\n- C. C) The particles move randomly\n- D.
