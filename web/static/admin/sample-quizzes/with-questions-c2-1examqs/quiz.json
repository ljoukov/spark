    "quizTitle": "GCSE Chemistry: States of Matter and Reactions",
    "summary": "This quiz covers fundamental concepts in GCSE Chemistry, focusing on states of matter, particle theory, and chemical reactions. It includes questions on interpreting phase change diagrams, applying state symbols in chemical equations, evaluating experimental setups, and understanding the characteristics of particles in different states. The questions are a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer formats, designed to test both knowledge recall and application skills, aligning with AQA GCSE Chemistry specifications.",

        "answer": "aq, g",
        "explanation": "Lithium hydroxide is formed as a solution in water, so its state symbol is 'aq' (aqueous). Hydrogen is a gas produced in the reaction, so its state symbol is 'g'.",

        "explanation": "To find the substance liquid over the greatest temperature range, calculate the difference between its boiling point and melting point. A: 20°C (10 - (-10)). B: 120°C (190 - 70). C: 200°C (210 - 10). D: 20°C (-160 - (-180)). Substance C has the largest range of 200°C.",

        "answer": "A and D",
        "explanation": "A substance is a gas when its temperature is above its boiling point. At 50°C, Substance A (Boiling Point ~10°C) is a gas. Substance B (Boiling Point ~190°C) is a solid. Substance C (Boiling Point ~210°C) is a liquid. Substance D (Boiling Point ~-160°C) is a gas. Therefore, A and D are gases at 50°C.",

        "answer": "The apparatus uses water as the heating medium. Water boils at 100°C, but substance B has a boiling point of 190°C. Therefore, water cannot reach a high enough temperature to boil substance B.",
        "explanation": "Substance B has a boiling point of 190°C (from Figure 1). The apparatus uses a water bath for heating. Water boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, meaning it cannot be heated above this temperature. Consequently, the water bath cannot provide enough heat to raise substance B to its boiling point of 190°C.",
