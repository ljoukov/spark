    "quizTitle": "GCSE Chemistry: States of Matter and Experimental Techniques",
    "summary": "This quiz covers key concepts in GCSE Chemistry, focusing on states of matter, chemical equations, and experimental techniques for determining melting and boiling points. It includes a mix of multiple-choice questions requiring data interpretation from graphs and short-answer questions assessing understanding of experimental design and chemical principles. The quiz aligns with AQA GCSE Triple Science (Chemistry) specifications, particularly topics related to the particle model and practical skills. Note: The provided source material for Figure 1 contains an anomaly for substance A where the boiling point appears lower than the melting point; interpretations for questions 1(b) and 1(c) are made based on the most plausible intended meaning for other substances.",

        "explanation": "A substance is a gas when its temperature is above its boiling point. At 50°C, substance A (boiling point approx -100°C) and substance D (boiling point approx -160°C) are both above their boiling points, and therefore are gases.",

        "answer": "Substance B has a boiling point of approximately 180°C (from Figure 1). The apparatus uses a water bath, which boils at 100°C. Therefore, the water bath cannot reach the temperature required to boil substance B.",

        "answer": "The thermometer is placed in the water bath, not directly in substance B. This means it measures the water temperature, not the exact temperature of substance B itself, leading to potential inaccuracies in the melting point measurement.",
        "explanation": "For an accurate measurement of the melting point, the thermometer should be in direct contact with the substance being tested. In this setup, the thermometer is in the surrounding water bath, which may not be at the exact same temperature as substance B, especially during phase changes.",
