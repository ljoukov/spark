        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Substance C has a melting point of approximately 10°C and a boiling point of approximately 200°C, giving it a liquid range of 190°C (200 - 10), which is the largest among the given substances.",

        "answer": "The apparatus uses a water bath, which can only heat substances up to 100°C. Substance B has a boiling point of approximately 190°C, which is higher than the maximum temperature achievable with a water bath.",
        "explanation": "A water bath is limited to heating substances up to 100°C, its own boiling point. Since substance B's boiling point is 190°C (from Figure 1), a water bath cannot provide sufficient heat to reach this temperature.",
