Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

    "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong 'Answer precision', with all responses being factually correct and well-justified based on the provided material. 'Difficulty alignment' is also excellent, offering a suitable range of challenge appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. Furthermore, 'Safety & tone' are maintained throughout. However, the quiz's 'Question quality' is slightly impacted by a significant anomaly in the source's Figure 1 for substance A (boiling point lower than melting point), which, despite being acknowledged in the quiz summary, could still cause confusion. More critically, the 'Coverage and balance' is incomplete as questions 2(a) and 2(b) from the source material, which address the particle model and kinetic energy, have been omitted.",

However, the inherent flaw in Figure 1 for substance A (boiling point lower than melting point) in the source material, though acknowledged in the quiz summary, slightly detracts from the overall quality of the data interpretation questions (1b, 1c) as they rely on this problematic data."
