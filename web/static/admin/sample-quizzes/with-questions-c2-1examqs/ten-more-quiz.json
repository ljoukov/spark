    "quizTitle": "GCSE Chemistry: States of Matter and Experimental Techniques",
    "summary": "This quiz covers key concepts in GCSE Chemistry, focusing on states of matter, chemical equations, and experimental techniques for determining melting and boiling points. It includes a mix of multiple-choice questions requiring data interpretation from graphs and short-answer questions assessing understanding of experimental design and chemical principles. The quiz aligns with AQA GCSE Triple Science (Chemistry) specifications, particularly topics related to the particle model and practical skills. Note: The provided source material for Figure 1 contains an anomaly for substance A where the boiling point appears lower than the melting point; interpretations for questions 1(b) and 1(c) are made based on the most plausible intended meaning for other substances.",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Substance B has a melting point of approximately 70°C and a boiling point of approximately 180°C. Since 100°C is above its melting point and below its boiling point, substance B would be in a liquid state.",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A water bath provides a more uniform and controlled temperature environment for heating substances compared to direct heating, which helps in obtaining more accurate melting or boiling point measurements.",

        "answer": "An oil bath or a heating mantle.",
        "explanation": "A water bath cannot exceed 100°C. For substances with higher boiling points like 250°C, an oil bath (which can reach higher temperatures) or a heating mantle (for direct, controlled heating of a flask) would be necessary.",

        "answer": "The balls do not represent the actual microscopic size of gas particles / the model does not show intermolecular forces between particles / the balls are all the same size and shape, unlike real gas particles which can vary / the model doesn't accurately represent the empty space between particles.",
        "explanation": "While useful for illustrating random motion and separation, the model simplifies many aspects. Real gas particles are microscopic, have specific chemical properties, and interact via weak intermolecular forces, none of which are perfectly represented by macroscopic balls.",
