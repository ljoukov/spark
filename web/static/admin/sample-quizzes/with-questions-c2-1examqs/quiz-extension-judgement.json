  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong 'Question quality' with precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready prompts. 'Answer precision' is excellent, with all answers being factually correct and directly grounded in the provided material. The 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a good mix of foundation, intermediate, and higher-level questions. Furthermore, the quiz adheres to 'Safety & tone' guidelines, avoiding misinformation and using appropriate UK English spelling. However, the 'Coverage and balance' dimension requires revision. While the quiz thoroughly covers states of matter and particle theory, it lacks sufficient questions on chemical reactions, which is a significant part of its stated title and summary.",

      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The core justification for the 'revise' verdict rests on the 'Coverage and balance' criterion, where the judge correctly identifies a significant imbalance. The quiz title is 'GCSE Chemistry: States of Matter and Reactions', yet 9 out of the 10 questions focus on states of matter and particle theory, with only a single question on chemical reactions (interpreting a state symbol). This skew makes the quiz's title and summary misleading. The judge's positive assessments of 'Question quality', 'Answer precision', and 'Difficulty alignment' are also appropriate, as the questions are generally well-constructed and cover a suitable range of cognitive skills for the target level.",
