  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to most rubric dimensions. Question quality is high, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready. The coverage and balance of topics are excellent, incorporating a suitable mix of question types and addressing key concepts relevant to GCSE Triple Science. Difficulty alignment is also well-managed, offering a varied challenge appropriate for the specified level. Furthermore, the quiz maintains a safe and appropriate tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content. However, a minor inconsistency was noted in the answer precision for one question, requiring a revision to the explanation.",

However, the explanation for Q23 contains a slight inconsistency where it correctly identifies 'D' as having the smallest range but then states the answer is 'A' (which corresponds to option D), creating a minor confusion that needs clarification for perfect precision."

      "explanation": "The judge correctly identifies a minor point of confusion in the explanation for question Q23. The explanation correctly states that substance D has the smallest liquid range, and the provided answer is 'A'. While option 'A' correctly corresponds to substance 'D', the explanation could be clearer by explicitly stating this link. The judge's assessment that this creates a 'minor confusion that needs clarification' is accurate and their 'revise' verdict is a reasonable and defensible request for a small improvement to achieve perfect precision.",
