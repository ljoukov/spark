    "quizTitle": "GCSE Triple Science Chemistry: Covalent Bonding Retrieval Quiz",
    "summary": "This quiz covers key concepts in Covalent Bonding (C2) as per the AQA GCSE Triple Science Chemistry specification. It includes a mix of recall and descriptive questions, focusing on the formation of covalent bonds, the structure and properties of giant covalent substances, small molecules, polymers, and their respective melting points. The quiz features two multiple-choice questions and four short-answer questions to test understanding of fundamental chemical structures and bonding.",

        "answer": "It takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms.",
