      {
        "id": "Q1_CB_MC1",
        "prompt": "How are covalent bonds formed?",
        "answer": "By atoms sharing electrons",
        "explanation": "Covalent bonds are formed when two non-metal atoms share one or more pairs of electrons to achieve a stable outer electron shell.",

        "options": [
          "By atoms sharing electrons",

        "prompt": "Which type of atoms typically form covalent bonds between them?",
        "answer": "Non-metals",
        "explanation": "Covalent bonds primarily occur between non-metal atoms, as they both have high electronegativity and tend to share electrons rather than transfer them.",

        "prompt": "Why do giant covalent substances have high melting points?",
        "answer": "It takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms.",
        "explanation": "Giant covalent structures consist of billions of atoms held together by a vast network of strong covalent bonds. A significant amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these strong bonds throughout the entire structure, leading to very high melting points.",

        "answer": "Only a small amount of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces.",
        "explanation": "Small molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds within the molecule, but the forces between individual molecules (intermolecular forces) are weak. Only a small amount of energy is required to overcome these weak intermolecular forces, resulting in low melting and boiling points.",

        "prompt": "Why can graphite conduct electricity?",
        "answer": "The delocalised electrons can move through the graphite.",
        "explanation": "In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms, leaving one outer electron per atom free. These electrons become delocalised and are free to move between the layers, allowing graphite to conduct electricity.",
