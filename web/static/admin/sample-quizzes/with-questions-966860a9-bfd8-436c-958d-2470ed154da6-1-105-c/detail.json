        "answer": "it takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms",
        "explanation": "Due to the extensive network of strong covalent bonds throughout the entire structure, a significant amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these bonds, resulting in high melting points.",

        "answer": "each carbon atom is bonded to three others in hexagonal rings arranged in layers â€“ it has delocalised electrons and weak forces between the layers",
        "explanation": "Graphite is a giant covalent structure where each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms, forming hexagonal rings arranged in layers. These layers are held together by weak intermolecular forces, and there are delocalised electrons within the layers.",

        "answer": "the delocalised electrons can move through the graphite",
        "explanation": "In graphite, each carbon atom forms only three covalent bonds, leaving one outer electron per atom delocalised. These delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the layers, allowing graphite to conduct electricity.",
