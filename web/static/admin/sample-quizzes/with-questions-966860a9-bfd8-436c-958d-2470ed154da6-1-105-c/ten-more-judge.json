Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

    "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent adherence to all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, directly mirroring the style and content expected at GCSE level. 'Answer precision' is faultless, as all answers and their accompanying explanations are factually correct and directly grounded in the provided source material. The 'Coverage and balance' are appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, addressing key concepts of covalent bonding, structures, properties, and carbon allotropes with a suitable mix of short-answer and multiple-choice question types. 'Difficulty alignment' is well-judged, with questions appropriately categorised from foundation to higher, ensuring varied challenge. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are impeccable, with no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content, and consistent use of UK English spelling.",
