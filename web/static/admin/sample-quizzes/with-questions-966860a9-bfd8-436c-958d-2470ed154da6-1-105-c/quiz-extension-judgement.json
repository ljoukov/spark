  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The question quality is consistently high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready. Answer precision is impeccable, with all answers being factually correct and directly grounded in the material provided and general GCSE Chemistry knowledge. The coverage and balance are strong, effectively addressing key concepts in covalent bonding and carbon allotropes through a suitable mix of question types. Difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a well-varied range of challenge. Lastly, the safety and tone are exemplary, with no misinformation or off-spec content, and correct UK English spelling.",
