  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and directly derived from the provided GCSE retrieval practice material, making them exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is faultless; all answers are factually correct, directly grounded in the source text, and supported by clear, accurate explanations. The 'Coverage and balance' are appropriate for an 'extension' quiz on Covalent Bonding, covering key concepts like giant covalent structures, small molecules, polymers, and various carbon allotropes with a suitable mix of short answer and multiple-choice questions. 'Difficulty alignment' is well-judged, with questions ranging from foundation to higher, appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are fully met, with no misinformation or off-spec content, and consistent use of UK English spelling.",
