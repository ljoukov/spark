  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The question quality is high, with precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready prompts that effectively assess understanding. Answer precision is flawless, with all answers being factually correct and directly grounded in the provided source material. The coverage and balance are comprehensive, addressing key concepts of covalent bonding, simple and giant molecular structures, polymers, and carbon allotropes, with a suitable mix of question types (multiple choice, short answer, true/false). Difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a good range of challenge from foundation recall to higher-level synthesis. Finally, safety & tone are perfectly maintained, with no misinformation or off-spec content, and correct UK English spelling. The quiz is well-structured and effectively extends the learning from the source material.",
