        "id": "Q7",
        "prompt": "Which type of atoms typically form covalent bonds with each other?",
        "answer": "non-metals",
        "explanation": "Covalent bonds are predominantly formed between non-metal atoms, as they both tend to gain electrons to achieve a full outer shell, making sharing electrons a stable arrangement.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A. Metals and non-metals",
          "B. Metals only",

        "answer": "small numbers of atoms group together into molecules with strong covalent bonds between the atoms and weak intermolecular forces between the molecules",
        "explanation": "Small molecules consist of a limited number of atoms joined by strong covalent bonds. However, the forces between these individual molecules (intermolecular forces) are weak.",

        "answer": "many identical molecules joined together by strong covalent bonds in a long chain, with weak intermolecular forces between the chains",

        "id": "Q10",
        "prompt": "Why do substances made of small molecules generally have low melting points?",
        "answer": "only a small amount of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces",
        "explanation": "Small molecular substances have low melting points because only a small amount of energy is required to overcome the weak intermolecular forces between the molecules, not to break the strong covalent bonds within them.",

        "answer": "the intermolecular forces are stronger in large molecules",
        "explanation": "As molecules increase in size, the cumulative strength of the weak intermolecular forces between them becomes greater. More energy is therefore needed to overcome these stronger forces, leading to higher melting and boiling points.",

        "answer": "do not have delocalised electrons or ions",
        "explanation": "For a substance to conduct electricity, it must possess mobile charge carriers, such as delocalised electrons or free ions. Most covalent substances lack these, as their electrons are held tightly in bonds or within specific atoms.",

        "answer": "layers are not bonded so can slide over each other",
        "explanation": "Graphite is soft because its structure consists of distinct layers of carbon atoms. The forces between these layers are very weak, allowing them to slide easily over one another, which also makes graphite a good lubricant.",
