        "prompt": "Which statement correctly contrasts the forces overcome when melting a simple molecular substance and a giant covalent substance?",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When melting a simple molecular substance, weak intermolecular forces are overcome. For a giant covalent substance, a large number of strong covalent bonds must be broken, which requires significantly more energy.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A. Strong covalent bonds are broken in both types of substances.",
          "B. Weak intermolecular forces are broken in simple molecules, while strong covalent bonds are broken in giant structures.",
          "C. Weak intermolecular forces are broken in both types of substances.",
