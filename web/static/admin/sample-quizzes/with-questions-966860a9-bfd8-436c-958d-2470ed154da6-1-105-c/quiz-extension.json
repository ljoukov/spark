        "prompt": "Which statement correctly explains why simple molecular substances have low boiling points?",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To boil a simple molecular substance, energy is needed to overcome the weak intermolecular forces between the molecules, not the strong covalent bonds within them. This requires only a small amount of energy.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A. The strong covalent bonds within the molecules are easily broken.",
          "B. Only weak intermolecular forces between molecules need to be overcome.",

        "answer": "Their hollow cage-like structure allows them to enclose and transport other molecules.",
