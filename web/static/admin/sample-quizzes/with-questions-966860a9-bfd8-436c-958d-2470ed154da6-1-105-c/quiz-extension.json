    "quizTitle": "AQA GCSE Chemistry C2 Covalent Bonding Retrieval Quiz - Extension",
    "summary": "This extension quiz builds upon fundamental concepts of covalent bonding, delving deeper into the structures and properties of giant covalent substances, small molecules, and polymers. It also expands on carbon allotropes, including detailed descriptions of graphite, graphene, fullerenes, and nanotubes, and their specific properties and uses.
