    "quizTitle": "GCSE Chemistry: Covalent Bonding and Allotropes Retrieval Quiz",
    "summary": "This quiz covers fundamental concepts of covalent bonding, including formation, types of atoms involved, and the structures and properties of various covalent substances. It also includes questions on carbon allotropes like graphite, graphene, and fullerenes. The quiz features a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer questions, designed to test recall and explanatory skills. The syllabus alignment is general to AQA GCSE Chemistry C2 topics, as specific specification points were not provided in the source material.",

      {
        "id": "C2-Q1",
        "prompt": "How are covalent bonds formed?",
        "answer": "B) By atoms sharing electrons",
        "explanation": "Covalent bonds are formed when two non-metal atoms share a pair of electrons, allowing both atoms to achieve a stable outer electron shell.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A) By atoms transferring electrons",
          "B) By atoms sharing electrons",
          "C) By atoms gaining electrons",
          "D) By atoms losing electrons"

        "prompt": "Which type of atoms form covalent bonds between them?",
        "answer": "C) Non-metals only",
        "explanation": "Covalent bonds typically form between non-metal atoms as they both have a strong attraction for electrons and can achieve a stable electron configuration by sharing.",

        "options": [
          "A) Metals and non-metals",
          "B) Metals only",

        "prompt": "Why do giant covalent substances have high melting points?",
        "answer": "It takes a lot of energy to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms.",
        "explanation": "Giant covalent substances, such as diamond or silicon dioxide, have extremely high melting points because a vast amount of energy is required to overcome the strong covalent bonds extending throughout the entire structure.",
