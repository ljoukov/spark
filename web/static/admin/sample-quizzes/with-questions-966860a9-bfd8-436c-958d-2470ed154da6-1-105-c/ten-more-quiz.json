        "answer": "C) Only a small amount of energy is needed to break the weak intermolecular forces.",
        "explanation": "Small molecules have low melting points because only a small amount of energy is required to overcome the weak intermolecular forces holding the molecules together, not the strong covalent bonds within the molecules.",

        "answer": "The intermolecular forces are stronger in large molecules.",
        "explanation": "As molecules get larger, the intermolecular forces between them become stronger. More energy is therefore required to overcome these stronger forces, leading to higher melting and boiling points compared to smaller molecules.",

        "explanation": "For a substance to conduct electricity, it must have mobile charged particles, such as delocalised electrons or ions. Most covalent substances do not possess these, as their electrons are held in fixed covalent bonds.",

        "explanation": "In graphite, each carbon atom forms strong covalent bonds with three other carbon atoms, creating hexagonal rings arranged in flat layers. One electron from each carbon atom is delocalised, allowing for electrical conductivity, and weak intermolecular forces exist between the layers.",
