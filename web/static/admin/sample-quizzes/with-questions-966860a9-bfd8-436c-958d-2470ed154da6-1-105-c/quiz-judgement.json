  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates excellent \"Question quality\" and \"Answer precision\", with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, and answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material. \"Difficulty alignment\" is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable mix of foundation and intermediate questions. The \"Safety & tone\" are also exemplary. However, the \"Coverage and balance\" is significantly limited, as only a third of the available questions from the source material have been included, leading to omissions of several key concepts.",

      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is entirely reasonable. The judge correctly identifies that the quality of the individual questions and answers is high, but the quiz's main failing is its poor coverage. The candidate quiz only uses 6 out of the 18 available questions from the source material. The judge accurately points out that this omits several key topics, such as polymers, fullerenes, and nanotubes. This significant lack of coverage fully justifies the low score for the 'Coverage and balance' criterion and the overall 'revise' verdict.",
