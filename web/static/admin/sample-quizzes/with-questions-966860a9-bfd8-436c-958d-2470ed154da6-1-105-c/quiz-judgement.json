  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is high, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, further enhanced by the intelligent splitting of multi-part questions from the source material (e.g., Q17, Q18). Answer precision is flawless, with all answers factually correct and directly grounded in the provided textbook content. The quiz exhibits strong coverage and balance, comprehensively addressing key concepts within GCSE Covalent Bonding and Carbon Allotropes, with an appropriate mix of recall and explanatory question types. Difficulty alignment is well-judged, offering a suitable range of challenge levels (foundation, intermediate, higher) appropriate for GCSE Triple Science. Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate safety and tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content, and consistently uses UK English spelling.",

      "explanation": "The judge's assessment is thorough and accurate. The candidate quiz successfully extracts all 18 question-answer pairs from the source material. The judge correctly identifies the key strength of the submission: the intelligent splitting of multi-part questions (source Q17 and Q18) into more focused, atomic questions (Q17a/b and Q18a/b). This enhances the quiz's quality beyond a simple extraction. The judge's praise for answer precision, coverage, and difficulty alignment is also well-founded. The verdict is entirely reasonable.",
