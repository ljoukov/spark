    "quizTitle": "GCSE Chemistry C1: Atomic Structure, Models, and Mixtures (Extended)",
    "summary": "This extended quiz builds upon fundamental concepts from AQA GCSE Chemistry C1, delving deeper into atomic models (Dalton, Plum Pudding, Nuclear), the discovery and properties of sub-atomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons), electron shell configurations, and the definition of isotopes. It includes 10 new questions, expanding on the initial quiz to provide a comprehensive review of atomic structure and related concepts.",
