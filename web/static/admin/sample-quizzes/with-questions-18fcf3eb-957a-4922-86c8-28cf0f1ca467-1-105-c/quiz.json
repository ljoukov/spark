        "prompt": "What did scientists discover in the alpha scattering experiment?",
        "answer": "Some alpha particles were deflected by the gold foil. This showed that an atom's mass and positive charge must be concentrated in one small space (the nucleus).",
        "explanation": "The alpha scattering experiment, led by Rutherford, disproved the plum pudding model by showing that a dense, positively charged nucleus exists at the centre of an atom.",
