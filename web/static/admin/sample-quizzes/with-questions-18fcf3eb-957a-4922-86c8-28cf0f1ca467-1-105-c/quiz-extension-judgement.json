  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates strong adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is consistently high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and suitable for GCSE examinations. Answer precision is excellent, as all provided answers are factually correct and directly supported by established scientific principles relevant to GCSE Chemistry. The quiz exhibits good coverage and balance, addressing key concepts within atomic structure and models through a suitable mix of question types. Difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge level from foundation to higher. Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate safety and tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content, and consistently uses UK English spelling.",
