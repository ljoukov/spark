  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The quiz demonstrates strong \"Question quality\" with precise and unambiguous prompts, and \"Answer precision\" with factually correct and well-explained answers. The \"Difficulty alignment\" is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range of challenge. Furthermore, the quiz adheres to \"Safety & tone\" guidelines, avoiding any misinformation or off-spec content. However, the quiz falls short on \"Coverage and balance\" as it exclusively focuses on atomic structure and sub-atomic particles, neglecting key concepts related to elements, compounds, mixtures, isotopes, and separation techniques, which are present in the source material (C1 questions 15-20) and explicitly mentioned in the syllabus alignment (4.2.1 Purity, mixtures and formulations).",

      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is entirely correct. The candidate quiz, despite its title including \"Separation Techniques\" and its syllabus alignment referencing \"Purity, mixtures and formulations\", completely fails to include any questions on these topics. The quiz exclusively draws from the first half of the source material (questions 1-14 on atomic structure) and ignores the second half (questions 15-20 on elements, compounds, mixtures, isotopes, and separation techniques). The judge accurately identifies this significant failure in coverage and balance, while correctly assessing the high quality of the questions that were included. The 'revise' verdict is therefore well-justified.",
