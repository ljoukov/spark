  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent quality across all rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and clearly exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is consistently accurate, with all answers factually correct and directly grounded in the provided C1 revision material. The 'Coverage and balance' are well-maintained, addressing key concepts from atomic structure, historical models, elements, compounds, mixtures, isotopes, electron shells, and separation techniques, with a suitable mix of question types (multiple choice, true/false, numeric, short answer). 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a varied challenge from foundation to higher-tier questions, suitable for an extension quiz. Finally, 'Safety & tone' are impeccable, with no misinformation, harmful, or off-spec content, and correct UK English spelling.",

      "explanation": "The judge's assessment is thorough and accurate. The candidate's quiz successfully fulfills the 'extension' brief by creating a new set of questions that test the source material in different ways (e.g., multiple choice, true/false, numeric input) and require synthesis of information from multiple points in the source (e.g., Q22, Q30). The judge correctly identifies the high quality of the questions, the factual accuracy of the answers, the balanced coverage of topics, and the appropriate difficulty alignment for a GCSE extension quiz. The justifications for each rubric score are sound and well-supported by the candidate's submission. I fully concur with the 'approve' verdict.",
