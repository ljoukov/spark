  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates excellent adherence to the rubric dimensions. The 'Question quality' is consistently high, with prompts that are precise, unambiguous, and clearly exam-ready. 'Answer precision' is faultless, as all answers are factually correct, well-explained, and directly grounded in the relevant scientific principles. The 'Coverage and balance' are commendable, offering a suitable mix of question types (multiple-choice, numeric, true/false, short answer) and effectively addressing key concepts within atomic structure, historical models, and properties of matter. Furthermore, the 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, with a good spread of foundation, intermediate, and higher-level questions. Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate 'Safety & tone', free from misinformation or off-spec content, and uses correct UK English spelling.",
