Judge the quality of the given text — not whether it is AI-written.\nWork in three passes: (1) skim and summarise the purpose/audience; (2) extract minimal spans proving issues; (3) score each axis 0-4 with ≤25 word rationale, then produce JSON.\nGeneral guidance: focus on reader value, consider context, and code the single most significant issue per span. Prefer precise spans over long quotes.\nRubric:\n- Density — flag filler or low-information wording. 0=clean, 4=pervasive filler.\n- Relevance — stays on task; penalise tangents. 0=on-task, 4=mostly irrelevant.\n- Factuality — accuracy and hallucinations. 0=correct, 4=core fabrications.\n- Bias — unjustified subjectivity or missing POV. 0=balanced, 4=pervasive skew.\n- Structure — repetition or templated phrasing. 0=varied, 4=formulaic skeleton.\n- Coherence — logical flow. 0=flows, 4=incoherent or contradictory.\n- Tone — fluency, verbosity, complexity. 0=natural, 4=burdens comprehension.\nScoring scale:\n- 0 — no issue observed.\n- 1 — slight issue; isolated.\n- 2 — recurring issue in local spans.\n- 3 — major issue across sections.\n- 4 — severe issue dominating the text.\nDomain weighting guidance:\n- News: emphasise Density, Relevance, Tone, Coherence, Bias.\n- QA: emphasise Factuality and Structure; Density/Relevance secondary.\n- Other: average of the two profiles.\nWhen quoting spans include char_start and char_end indices from the TEXT block (0-indexed, inclusive/exclusive).\nFor each axis include an auto_signals array of {\"name\":<metric>,\"value\":<number>} entries (max 4) using the most relevant metrics from AUTO_SIGNALS.\nAfter scoring compute domain-weighted risk = Σ((score/4)×weight). Use threshold 0.55 to set overall_slop.label (1=slop,0=clean). Confidence should reflect certainty in that label.\nReturn JSON only, matching the schema.\nDOMAIN: qa\nCONTEXT: This extended quiz builds upon fundamental concepts in GCSE Chemistry C1, further exploring atomic structure, historical models of the atom, properties of sub-atomic particles, and calculations related to atomic composition.

The difficulty ranges from foundation to higher.\nMode: extension\nSubject: chemistry\nBoard: AQA\nQuestion count: 10\n\nQ1: According to Dalton's model, what was the fundamental nature of atoms?\nTopic: Atomic Models\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Recall\nAnswer: Atoms were solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.\nOptions:\n- A. A. Atoms were solid spheres that could not be divided into smaller parts.\n- B. B. Atoms consisted of a positive sphere with electrons embedded within it.\n- C. C. Atoms had a dense, positively charged nucleus with electrons orbiting it.\n- D. D. Atoms were composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons in distinct energy levels.\nExplanation: John Dalton's atomic theory proposed that atoms were indivisible, indestructible solid spheres, and that all atoms of a given element were identical.\nSource reference: C1 questions, Q2\n\nQ2: The alpha scattering experiment, conducted by Rutherford and his team, led to which significant discovery about atomic structure?\nTopic: Atomic Models, Experimental Evidence\nDifficulty: higher\nSkill focus: Understanding\nAnswer: An atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small, dense nucleus.\nOptions:\n- A. A. Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels or shells.\n- B. B. Atoms were solid, indivisible spheres.\n- C. C. An atom's mass and positive charge are concentrated in a small, dense nucleus.\n- D. D. The atom is a sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded.\nExplanation: The deflection of some alpha particles by the gold foil indicated that the atom's positive charge and most of its mass were concentrated in a tiny central region, which Rutherford named the nucleus.\n\nQ3: Which statement best describes the nuclear model of the atom?\nTopic: Atomic Models\nDifficulty: intermediate\nSkill focus: Recall\nAnswer: It consists of a dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it.\nOptions:\n- A. A. A uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered throughout.\n- B. B. A dense nucleus with electrons orbiting it.\n- C. C. Indivisible solid spheres.\n- D. D. Electrons existing in fixed energy levels (shells).\nExplanation: The nuclear model, proposed by Rutherford, describes the atom as having a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at its center, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around it.\n\nQ4: Which sub-atomic particle, an uncharged particle, was discovered by James Chadwick?\nTopic: Sub-atomic Particles, History of Atomic Theory\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Recall\nAnswer: The neutron.\nOptions:\n- A. A. The proton.\n- B. B. The electron.\n- C. C. The neutron.\n- D. D.

A. In the electron shells.\n- B. B. Orbiting the nucleus.\n- C. C. In the nucleus.\n- D. D. Distributed throughout the atom's volume.\nExplanation: Protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons, are tightly packed together in the central part of the atom called the nucleus.\nSource reference: C1 questions, Q8\n\nQ6: What are the approximate relative masses of a proton, neutron, and electron, respectively?\nTopic: Sub-atomic Particles\nDifficulty: foundation\nSkill focus: Recall\nAnswer: Proton: 1, Neutron: 1, Electron: 0 (very small).\nOptions:\n- A. A. Proton: 1, Neutron: 1, Electron: 0 (very small).\n- B. B. Proton: 0, Neutron: 1, Electron: 1.\n- C. C. Proton: 1, Neutron: 0, Electron: 1.\n- D. D.

A. They only contain neutrons, which are neutral.\n- B. B. They contain equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons.\n- C. C. The positive charge of the nucleus is cancelled out by the negative charge of the neutrons.\n- D. D. Electrons are uncharged when in fixed energy levels.\nExplanation: In a neutral atom, the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus, resulting in a net charge of zero.\nSource reference: C1 questions, Q13\n\nQ10: According to the Bohr model, what is the maximum number of electrons that can be placed in the first, second, and third electron shells, respectively?\nTopic: Electron Configuration, Bohr Model\nDifficulty: intermediate\nSkill focus: Recall\nAnswer: Up to 2 in the first shell and up to 8 in the second and third shells.\nOptions:\n- A.
