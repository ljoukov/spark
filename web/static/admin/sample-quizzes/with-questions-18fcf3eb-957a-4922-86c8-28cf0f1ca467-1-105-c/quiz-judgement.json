  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong 'Question quality' with precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready prompts. 'Answer precision' is excellent, as all answers are factually correct and directly grounded in the provided source material. The 'Difficulty alignment' is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable mix of foundation and intermediate challenge levels. Furthermore, the quiz adheres to 'Safety & tone' guidelines, avoiding misinformation and using UK English spelling. However, the 'Coverage and balance' could be improved. While the quiz covers atomic structure and compounds well, it falls short of its stated summary goal to include 'definitions of elements, compounds, and mixtures' by omitting explicit questions on elements and mixtures. Additionally, other fundamental C1 concepts present in the source, such as isotopes and relative mass, are not included, leading to a less comprehensive coverage than ideal.",

      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The primary justification for the 'revise' verdict is the score for 'Coverage and balance', which the judge correctly identifies as a weakness. The candidate quiz's summary explicitly states it will cover 'definitions of elements, compounds, and mixtures', but it only includes a question about compounds, omitting questions on elements and mixtures which are present in the source material (Q15 and Q17). The judge also correctly notes that other relevant topics from the source, like isotopes and relative mass, are missing. This discrepancy between the stated scope in the summary and the actual content of the quiz makes the 'revise' verdict appropriate.",
