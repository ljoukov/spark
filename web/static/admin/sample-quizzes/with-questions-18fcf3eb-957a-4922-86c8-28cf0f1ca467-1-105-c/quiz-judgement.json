  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is excellent, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready, directly mirroring the style of GCSE recall questions. Answer precision is faultless, with all answers factually correct and directly derived from the provided source material. Coverage and balance are appropriate for the foundational C1 topics presented in the source, effectively addressing key concepts. Difficulty alignment is suitable for GCSE Triple Science, offering a mix of foundation and intermediate challenge levels. Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate safety and tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content, and uses correct UK English spelling.",
