  "prompt": "You are Spark's internal GCSE quiz quality judge. Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is excellent, with prompts being precise, unambiguous, and suitable for GCSE examinations. Answer precision is consistently high, with all answers factually correct and directly derived from the provided source material. The quiz exhibits comprehensive coverage and balance, addressing key concepts across atomic structure, the history of the atom, elements, compounds, mixtures, and separation techniques, with a good mix of skill focuses. Difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, featuring a suitable variation in challenge levels from foundation to higher. Finally, the quiz maintains an appropriate safety and tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content, and uses UK English spelling.",

While all questions are short-answer, this is consistent with the format of the source material, and the variety in 'skillFocus' compensates for the lack of question type diversity."

      "explanation": "The judge's verdict is well-reasoned and accurate. The candidate quiz is a faithful and high-quality extraction of the source material. The judge correctly notes that the quiz adheres to all rubric dimensions, including question quality, answer precision, and difficulty alignment. The judge's score of 0.9 for Coverage and Balance is a reasonable and nuanced assessment, acknowledging that while the quiz only contains one question type (short-answer), this is a direct result of the source material's format, and the quiz still covers a wide range of topics and skills. The judge also correctly identified the candidate's beneficial clarification in Q20, changing \"relative mass\" to \"relative atomic mass\". The overall approval is fully justified.",
