Review the proposed quiz objectively.\nRubric:\n- Question quality: Are prompts precise, unambiguous, and exam-ready?\n- Answer precision: Are answers factually correct and directly grounded in the material?\n- Coverage and balance: Do the questions cover key concepts with a suitable mix of types?\n- Difficulty alignment: Are items appropriate for GCSE Triple Science and varied in challenge?\n- Safety & tone: Avoid misinformation, harmful or off-spec content.\nUse the GCSE Triple Science context and ensure UK English spelling.\nReturn JSON with explanation first, then rubricFindings, and verdict last. Explanation must cite rubric dimensions.\nverdict must be \"approve\" when the quiz fully meets the rubric, otherwise \"revise\" with actionable reasoning.\nProvide rubricFindings as an array where each item references one rubric dimension with a 0-1 score.",

      "explanation": "The proposed quiz demonstrates strong adherence to the rubric dimensions. Question quality is consistently high, with precise and unambiguous prompts suitable for GCSE level. Answer precision is excellent, with all answers factually correct and directly derived from the provided source material. The difficulty alignment is appropriate for GCSE Triple Science, offering a suitable range from foundation to higher. Furthermore, the quiz maintains a safe and appropriate tone, free from misinformation or off-spec content. While coverage of atomic structure is comprehensive, the balance could be slightly improved by including one more question on separation techniques or related concepts to better represent the 'Purity, mixtures and formulations' section of the syllabus, though this is a minor point for a short quiz.",

It includes a good mix of short-answer and multiple-choice questions. However, with 5 questions on atomic structure and only 1 on separation techniques, the balance between the two main syllabus areas could be slightly more even for a broader representation of C1 content."

      "explanation": "The judge's assessment is excellent. The verdict to 'approve' is correct as the candidate quiz is of high quality, accurately extracting questions and answers from the provided source material. The judge's reasoning is sound, particularly in the 'Coverage and balance' section. The judge correctly identifies that the quiz is heavily weighted towards atomic structure (5 questions) versus separation techniques (1 question) and appropriately deducts a small amount from the score, while also acknowledging this is a minor point for a short quiz. This demonstrates a nuanced and accurate application of the rubric.",
