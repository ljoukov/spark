        "id": "Q21",
        "prompt": "Which conclusion was drawn directly from the observation that some alpha particles were deflected by the gold foil in the alpha scattering experiment?",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The deflection of positively charged alpha particles showed that they were being repelled by a concentrated positive charge within the atom. This led to the nuclear model, where the positive charge and mass are located in a small, dense nucleus.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A. The existence of electrons.",
          "B. The atom is mostly empty space.",

        "id": "Q22",
        "prompt": "Two atoms are isotopes of the same element. Which statement correctly describes the difference between them?",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Isotopes are defined as atoms of the same element (so they must have the same number of protons) but with different numbers of neutrons, which results in a different mass number.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [

        "prompt": "An atom has a mass number of 35 and an atomic number of 17. How many neutrons does it have?",
        "answer": "18",
        "explanation": "The number of neutrons is calculated by subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number (number of protons + neutrons). So, 35 - 17 = 18 neutrons.",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The plum pudding model described a 'sphere of positive charge' with electrons embedded, whereas the nuclear model, based on the alpha scattering experiment, proposed that the positive charge was concentrated in a central nucleus.",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "A. The plum pudding model includes neutrons, but the nuclear model does not.",

        "answer": "Because it is the average mass of all the atoms of an element, taking into account the different masses and abundances of its isotopes.",
        "explanation": "Most elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, which are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons (and thus different masses). The relative atomic mass is a weighted average of these isotopic masses.",

        "explanation": "Electrons fill shells starting with the one closest to the nucleus. The first shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, the second can hold a maximum of 8, and the third can also hold up to 8.
