  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "c21-q1",
      "prompt": "According to the worksheet, which ionic compound forms when magnesium reacts fully with oxygen?",
      "answer": "Magnesium oxide (MgO)",
      "explanation": "The worksheet summarises that Group 2 metals such as magnesium react with oxygen to make ionic oxides containing Mg2+ and O2− ions, giving the empirical formula MgO.",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": [
        "Magnesium oxide (MgO)",
        "Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2)",
        "Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4)",
        "Magnesium carbonate (MgCO3)"

    },
    {
      "id": "c21-q2",
      "prompt": "The sheet states that sodium chloride contains a giant ionic lattice. What particle-level explanation links this structure to its high melting point?",
      "answer": "Oppositely charged sodium and chloride ions are held by strong electrostatic attractions in all directions, so a lot of energy is needed to break the lattice.",
      "explanation": "Learners are reminded that the regular lattice of Na+ and Cl− ions produces strong, non-directional electrostatic forces that require significant energy to overcome, explaining the high melting point.",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "topic": "Structure and bonding",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "skillFocus": "Explain structure-property relationships.",

    {
      "id": "c21-q3",
      "prompt": "One task asks for the empirical formula of aluminium oxide. State the formula implied by the worksheet.",
      "answer": "Al2O3",
      "explanation": "The worked example highlights that Al3+ and O2− ions combine in the simplest whole-number ratio of two aluminium ions to three oxide ions, giving Al2O3.",
