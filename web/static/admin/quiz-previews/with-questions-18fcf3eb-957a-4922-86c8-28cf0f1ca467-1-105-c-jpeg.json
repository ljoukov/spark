    {
      "id": "img-c-q1",
      "prompt": "The worksheet asks for a dot-and-cross diagram of methane. What key features should the answer contain?",
      "answer": "A central carbon atom with four shared electron pairs to four hydrogen atoms, each pair containing one electron from carbon and one from hydrogen.",
      "explanation": "Mark scheme notes emphasise showing shared pairs between C and H and no lone pairs, evidencing a simple covalent molecule.",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "topic": "Covalent bonding",
      "difficulty": "foundation",
      "skillFocus": "Represent simple molecules using dot-and-cross diagrams.",
      "sourceReference": "Worksheet task 1"
    },
    {
      "id": "img-c-q2",
      "prompt": "One comparison asks why sodium chloride conducts electricity when molten but not when solid. Summarise the explanation expected.",
      "answer": "In the solid ionic lattice the ions are locked in place, but when molten the ions are free to move and carry charge.",
      "explanation": "Teacher comments point out that conductivity requires mobile charged particles, provided only when the ionic lattice melts.",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "topic": "Properties of ionic compounds",
      "difficulty": "foundation",
      "skillFocus": "Explain conductivity changes with state.",

    },
    {
      "id": "img-c-q3",
      "prompt": "The final prompt compares metallic and covalent bonding. Which property difference is highlighted on the answer sheet?",
      "answer": "Metals conduct electricity because delocalised electrons move freely, unlike simple covalent molecules.",
      "explanation": "The annotation stresses that the sea of delocalised electrons in metals enables conduction whereas discrete covalent molecules lack mobile charge carriers.",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": [
        "Metals conduct electricity because delocalised electrons move freely, unlike simple covalent molecules.",
        "Metals contain shared pairs only between two specific atoms just like covalent molecules.",
        "Covalent substances conduct better because their electrons are localised on ions.",
        "Both bonding types require ions arranged in a giant lattice to conduct."
