    {
      "id": "img-b-q1",
      "prompt": "The worksheet sketch shows an energy profile for an exothermic reaction. Which statement best summarises the energy change?",
      "answer": "The products sit at a lower energy than the reactants because energy is released to the surroundings.",
      "explanation": "Teacher annotations underline that exothermic profiles drop from reactants to products as heat is transferred out, giving a negative enthalpy change.",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": [
        "The products sit at a lower energy than the reactants because energy is released to the surroundings.",
        "Activation energy is negative because particles collide more slowly.",
        "Reactants have lower energy than products because they absorb heat.",
        "The profile is flat because the reaction reaches equilibrium."

      "id": "img-b-q2",
      "prompt": "One item requires calculating the energy change using bond energies. What method does the worksheet highlight?",
      "answer": "Add the energy needed to break bonds in reactants, subtract the energy released when new bonds form in products, and interpret the sign of the result.",
      "explanation": "The model answer guides students to sum bond-breaking energies, subtract bond-making energies and relate the overall sign to whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.",

      "id": "img-b-q3",
      "prompt": "Students comment on a temperature-time graph from a practical. What conclusion is expected about the observed drop in temperature?",
      "answer": "It indicates an endothermic process where the reaction absorbs heat from the solution, so the temperature falls.",
      "explanation": "Marking guidance next to the graph directs learners to link a falling temperature curve to heat absorption characteristic of an endothermic reaction.",
