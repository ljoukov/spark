  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "img-a-q1",
      "prompt": "The photo shows a question asking for the ionic equation when silver nitrate is added to sodium chloride. What balanced ionic equation is expected?",
      "answer": "Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s)",
      "explanation": "Learners are prompted to remove spectator ions and combine aqueous Ag⁺ and Cl⁻ ions to form the silver chloride precipitate, matching the exemplar in the worksheet.",
      "type": "short_answer",
      "topic": "Ionic equations",
      "difficulty": "foundation",

    },
    {
      "id": "img-a-q2",
      "prompt": "One part checks balancing of the iron and copper displacement reaction. What ionic equation should students provide?",
      "answer": "Fe(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Fe²⁺(aq) + Cu(s)",
      "explanation": "The captured answer line expects the oxidation of iron to Fe²⁺ while Cu²⁺ gains electrons to form copper metal, illustrating redox in displacement reactions.",

      "topic": "Redox reactions",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "skillFocus": "Represent changes in oxidation state using ionic equations.",

    },
    {
      "id": "img-a-q3",
      "prompt": "According to the marking guidance on the sheet, why must state symbols be included in ionic equations?",
      "answer": "They show the physical state of each species and confirm which product is a precipitate.",
      "explanation": "The teacher notes alongside the image stress that correct state symbols demonstrate understanding of which ions remain aqueous and which form the solid precipitate.",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": [
        "They show the physical state of each species and confirm which product is a precipitate.",
        "They replace the need to balance charge conservation.",
        "They remove spectator ions from the equation entirely.",
        "They convert the equation into a molecular representation."
