      "prompt": "According to the leaflet, list two eligibility checks that must be passed before someone can donate blood.",
      "answer": "Potential donors must meet the minimum age and weight requirements and pass the health screening questions about recent illnesses or travel.",

      "answer": "Antibodies in the recipient attack the donated red cells causing them to clump and block vessels.",
      "explanation": "The leaflet highlights that mismatched groups trigger an immune reaction where antibodies agglutinate donor cells, which can be life-threatening.",

        "Antibodies in the recipient attack the donated red cells causing them to clump and block vessels.",
        "The donated blood evaporates quickly so the transfusion fails.",
        "The recipient instantly forms more red blood cells to dilute the transfusion.",
        "The donation permanently changes the recipientâ€™s own blood group."
