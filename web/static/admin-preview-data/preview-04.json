    "summary": "This quiz covers fundamental concepts in AQA GCSE Chemistry, focusing on states of matter, chemical equations, and the particle model. It includes questions on interpreting graphical data for melting and boiling points, applying knowledge of state symbols in chemical reactions, and understanding the characteristics of particles in different states. The question mix includes short answer and multiple-choice questions, testing both recall and data interpretation skills across foundation, intermediate, and higher difficulty levels.",

        "prompt": "Lithium reacts with water to produce lithium hydroxide solution and hydrogen. Use the correct state symbols from the box (aq, g, l, s) to complete the chemical equation: 2Li(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2LiOH(__) + H2(__)",
        "answer": "aq, g",
        "explanation": "Lithium hydroxide is formed as a solution in water, hence 'aq' (aqueous). Hydrogen is a gas, hence 'g'.",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From Figure 1: Substance A is liquid from approx. -100°C to 0°C (range 100°C). Substance B is liquid from approx. 70°C to 190°C (range 120°C). Substance C is liquid from approx. 10°C to 190°C (range 180°C). Substance D is liquid from approx. -180°C to -120°C (range 60°C). Therefore, substance C has the greatest liquid temperature range.",

        "answer": "A and D",
        "explanation": "At 50°C: Substance A has a boiling point of 0°C, so it is a gas. Substance B has a boiling point of 190°C, so it is a liquid. Substance C has a boiling point of 190°C, so it is a liquid. Substance D has a boiling point of -120°C, so it is a gas. Therefore, A and D are gases at 50°C.",

        "answer": "The apparatus shown uses a water bath. Water boils at 100°C. From Figure 1, substance B has a boiling point of approximately 190°C, which is much higher than the boiling point of water. Therefore, the water bath cannot reach the temperature required to boil substance B.",
        "explanation": "A water bath can only heat substances up to 100°C (the boiling point of water). Substance B has a boiling point of approximately 190°C, which is significantly higher than 100°C. Thus, the water bath cannot provide enough heat to reach the boiling point of substance B.",

        "answer": "The balls are far apart from each other and move randomly.",

        "answer": "1. Solid. 2. Gas.",
        "explanation": "Particles in a solid are arranged in a fixed, regular pattern. Particles in a gas have the highest kinetic energy because they move randomly and rapidly, colliding with each other and the container walls.",
