This is a SvelteKit app, it usees latest version of Svelte and SvelteKit, docs are here: https://svelte.dev/llms.txt

- Product spec and flows: see `../docs/SPEC.md`.

# Technology Stack

- Use SvelteKit
- USe TypeScript
- Run npm lint and fix errors
- Use TailwindCSS (it is already installed)
- SvelteKit has had several important changes: runes and remote functions (see web/docs/sveltekit-docs.md)
- routes/api endpoints are for the mobile app only, do not call them directly in SvelteKit app, use native SvelteKit way to call the server instead (see web/docs/sveltekit-docs.md)
- use zod to validate JSON and data coming from storage, LLMs or network
- we use shadcn-svelte components library docs are in web/docs/shadcn-svelte.md
- Use absolute imports (unless current directory)
- Use $lib/ and $proto/ aliases, e.g. `import { runGeminiCall } from '@spark/llm/utils/gemini';`
- Prefer static imports. Do **not** use dynamic `import()` in the web app unless specifically asked—mixing modes prevents Vite
  from emitting separate chunks and surfaces warnings during build.

**Authentication**

- Admin and App Area (`/admin` and `/app`)
  - Uses Firebase Auth in the browser (both redirect and popup options are available) so the client can use Firestore real-time listeners freely. Example UI: `web/src/routes/app/+page.svelte`.
  - All app → server API calls must include a Firebase ID token (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <idToken>`). The server validates tokens using the Firebase Admin SDK. See helpers in `web/src/lib/server/utils/firebaseAdmin.ts:68` and token verification utilities in `web/src/lib/server/utils/firebaseServer.ts:23`.

  - We keep Firebase Hosting deployed only to make the Firebase Auth helper endpoints available at `__/auth/*` and to test client sign-in. See the lightweight demo page at `web/public/index.html`.
  - The SvelteKit app itself is deployed to Vercel; Hosting is not used for app routing.

- Notes
  - Follow `docs/SPEC.md` for auth and validation requirements. All external inputs must be validated with `zod` and normalized before use.

**Gemini**

Gemini API

- Model selection: Hardcode model IDs per task based on evals. Default to `gemini-2.5-flash` for the quiz extraction/generation/judging pipeline (validated in integration tests). Escalate to `gemini-2.5-pro` only for new tasks that demonstrably require heavier OCR or long-form reasoning. Do not use a `GEMINI_MODEL` env var.
- API route: `POST /api/admin/chat` — body `{ messages: {role:'user'|'model', content:string}[] }`, streams plain text.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is already set in then env variables.

Gemini Prompting & Structured Output

- Prompting guide: use structured output to get JSON the server can validate.
  Docs: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output#javascript

Example (Node/TS) using `@google/genai`:

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI, Type } from '@google/genai';

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

export async function exampleStructuredOutput() {
	const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
		// Choose model explicitly; no env override.
		// Use "gemini-2.5-flash" for simple tasks; switch to "gemini-2.5-pro" for harder ones.
		model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
		contents: 'List a few popular cookie recipes, and include the amounts of ingredients.',
		config: {
			responseMimeType: 'application/json',
			responseSchema: {
				type: Type.ARRAY,
				items: {
					type: Type.OBJECT,
					properties: {
						recipeName: { type: Type.STRING },
						ingredients: { type: Type.ARRAY, items: { type: Type.STRING } }
					},
					propertyOrdering: ['recipeName', 'ingredients']
				}
			}
		}
	});

	return response.text; // JSON string per responseMimeType
}
```

Validation and retries

- Always validate model JSON with `zod` before use. Normalize with `transform()`.
- On validation error or transient Gemini error, retry once (max retries = 2 total attempts).
- Handle known error classes:
  - Rate-limited: back off (e.g., 500–1000ms jitter) and retry once.
  - Quota/insufficient funds: do not retry; return 402/429 style error to client.
  - Invalid request/schema mismatch: log and fix prompt/schema; do not retry blindly.
- Never trust unvalidated model output for writes; only write validated, typed data.

Model policy examples

- Quiz extraction/judging flows → `gemini-2.5-flash` (escalate only if flash regresses).
- Free-text grading with rubric → `gemini-2.5-pro`.
- MCQ/TF/short generation from notes → `gemini-2.5-flash` (escalate to `-pro` on low confidence).
- Summary bullets → `gemini-2.5-flash`.

**Testing**

- use vitest
- use name.test.ts file generally located right in the same dir as the file they test (name.ts and name.test.ts)
- web/src/tests directory for utilities specifically for testing (eg proxy setup)
- Vite emits bundler warnings (for example, about dynamic imports) during `npm run build`. Run the build when touching import
  graphs to catch these early.
- `npm run all-tests` runs lint, check, test, and build sequentially. Codex is encouraged to run it for larger changes before
  submitting work.
